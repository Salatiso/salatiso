Modern, Broke, and Confused: 
A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Progress

‚ÄúThe Khoisan and  Bantu were told to trade their animal skins for top hats and wool coats in the sweltering African sun, all in the name of sophistication. 
Instead, they got sweaty armpits and heatstroke, proving that "progress" sometimes just means being uncomfortable in style."

Prologue: Modern, Broke, and Confused: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Progress

Once upon a time‚Äîbefore electricity, taxes, and the glorious invention of the queue at Home Affairs‚ÄîAfricans lived in close-knit communities, raised their children together, and didn‚Äôt spend half their lives paying off a house they‚Äôll finish owning at 70, just in time to die.
Then the Europeans arrived.
And they took one long, horrified look at everything and said:
üö® ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù üö®
They saw our clothing (or lack thereof) and decided we needed to sweat in three-piece suits in the African heat.
They saw our spiritual beliefs and decided we needed to fear hell more than we feared droughts.
They saw our self-sufficient family structures and decided we needed something called "nuclear families," where parents and children live alone, unsupported, and eventually die in nursing homes.
They saw our perfectly functional communal way of life and decided we needed something called "progress."
Fast-forward a few centuries, and here we are.
We have Western-style democracy‚Äîbut the people we vote for are usually just looting enthusiasts with good PR.
We have formal education‚Äîbut half the people graduating can‚Äôt find jobs, and the other half are drowning in student debt.
We have "free" healthcare‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs only free if you don‚Äôt mind waiting six months for an appointment.
We have infrastructure‚Äîexcept the roads are crumbling, the trains are missing, and Eskom thinks electricity is a part-time service.
This, my friends, is the Progress Paradox.
They told us that modernity would fix everything.
Instead, we got corruption, crime, and a government that collects more taxes than it delivers services.

But Let‚Äôs Be Fair‚ÄîNot Everything Is Bad
Now, before you accuse me of being anti-modernization, relax‚ÄîI love my WiFi and hot showers as much as the next person.
Some good came with colonization and industrialization.

Electricity? Great! (Except for the part where we can‚Äôt always rely on it.)
Medicine? Life-saving! (Though sometimes, you leave the clinic sicker than when you arrived.)
Technology? Game-changing! (Though now, half of it is wasted on TikTok challenges and misinformation, whatever that is.)

But we must also acknowledge what was lost.

We lost self-sufficiency‚Äînow we beg the government for things our ancestors provided for themselves.
We lost strong family structures‚Äînow therapists replace elders, and wisdom is something you have to pay for.
We lost cultural identity‚Äînow some of us know Shakespeare better than we know our own history.

Worst of all?
We got so attached to these systems that we now defend them‚Äîeven when they fail us.

A Journey Through the Madness of ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù
This book isn‚Äôt a history lesson‚Äîit‚Äôs a satirical deep dive into how we ended up here.

We‚Äôll explore how the Khoi and San met the Bantu, and how the Xhosa, Zulu, and other African groups encountered the Western colonizers‚Äîleading to a history that‚Äôs equal parts fascinating and infuriating.

We‚Äôll look at how we went from practical, climate-friendly clothing to sweating in suits for professionalism.
We‚Äôll laugh (and cry) about how informal education‚Äîrooted in real-world skills‚Äîwas replaced by a rigid school system that produces more debt than jobs.
We‚Äôll unpack how marriage customs evolved‚Äîand how modernity left more women raising children alone.
We‚Äôll examine laws that were supposed to bring order but instead created chaos, crime, and inequality.

And when we‚Äôre done? We‚Äôll move on to Book Two: Civilized, Struggling, and Still Confused: The Side Effects of Progress, where we‚Äôll unpack the joys of democracy (which works best if you don‚Äôt ask too many questions), the great tax scam, and why crime remains the only sector with reliable job growth.

Who Should Read This Book?
This book is for everyone who has ever wondered:
‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ are we actually better off now than before?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do people who work hard get taxed the most, while those who loot get government contracts?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy are we still wearing suits in Africa while Europeans now walk around barely clothed?‚Äù
‚ÄúIf progress is real, why do things feel worse?‚Äù
If you enjoy dark humor, historical irony, and brutally honest discussions about African history and modernity, then you‚Äôre in the right place.

Final Thought: Progress Isn‚Äôt Always Forward
The West told us they were bringing us progress.
But if progress means broken families, a collapsing economy, rising crime, and a government that steals more than the criminals‚Äîthen maybe we need to rethink what progress actually means.
So grab a drink, settle in, and let‚Äôs take a journey through Modern, Broke, and Confused: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Progress.
You‚Äôll laugh. You‚Äôll think. You might even get a little angry.
But most importantly‚Äîyou‚Äôll never look at ‚Äúprogress‚Äù the same way again.








Part 1
Chapter 1: How My Ancestors Met My Other Ancestors and Things Got‚Ä¶ Complicated
Long before colonialism, Youtube, and Eskom‚Äôs load-shedding schedule‚Äîbefore land debates, identity crises, and Twitter arguments‚Äîthere were two great migrations shaping Southern Africa: the Khoisan, already here, living in harmony with nature, and the Bantu, moving southward with their cattle, iron, and big ideas.
The story of South Africa doesn‚Äôt start with Europeans lost at sea‚Äîit starts with these two groups, meeting for the first time, and trying to figure out whether they were going to be best friends, uneasy neighbors, or lifelong rivals.

The Khoisan: The First South Africans
Before the Bantu arrived, the Khoisan had already cracked the survival game. They lived off the land, moving with the seasons, never worrying about property taxes or municipal bills.
The San were master hunters and gatherers, tracking animals with skills that made modern GPS look embarrassing.
The Khoi were herders, tending cattle and trading with neighboring communities.
They didn‚Äôt have kings or chiefs; leadership wasn‚Äôt about power, but wisdom‚Äîif you had the best advice (or the best aim with a bow and arrow), you were respected.
Their philosophy was simple: Why ‚Äúown‚Äù land when you can share it? Why hoard wealth when generosity ensured survival? Why create written laws when everyone knew that stealing someone‚Äôs antelope was just plain wrong?
For thousands of years, this worked. And then, from the north, a new wave of people arrived.

The Bantu Migration: Cattle, Iron, and a Different Way of Doing Things
The Bantu weren‚Äôt just travelers; they were revolutionaries in agriculture, metallurgy, and social organization. Their journey from Central Africa was one of the greatest human migrations in history, driven by the search for fertile land and resources.
They brought: 
Iron tools ‚Äì because farming with sharpened bones is fun, but plows make life easier. 
Cattle ‚Äì wealth on four legs, providing milk, meat, and status. 
Hierarchical societies ‚Äì where leadership wasn‚Äôt just about advice, but also about control.
By the time they reached Southern Africa, the Bantu had already established farming communities, built kingdoms, and refined the art of accumulating wealth. Cattle were their currency, power was centralized, and land was something you owned‚Äînot something you borrowed from nature.
Now, if this were a Hollywood movie, the Khoisan and Bantu would have seen each other across the plains, exchanged cultural pleasantries, and immediately formed a united society.
But this was Africa.

A Clash of Worldviews: Trade, Marriage, and a Few Cattle Raids
Whenever two cultures meet, history offers three likely scenarios: 
They ignore each other (which wasn‚Äôt going to happen‚Äîcattle tend to wander). 
They trade and exchange ideas (which they did, with the Khoisan sharing their survival skills and the Bantu introducing iron tools). 
They fight (because, well... humans and land disputes go way back).
Some Khoisan resisted the Bantu‚Äôs expansion, leading to conflicts over grazing lands, water sources, and, most importantly, cattle‚Äîthe original South African gold. Others intermarried, blending customs and languages. This fusion gave rise to the Xhosa people, whose language still carries the Khoisan influence through distinctive click sounds.
Some Khoisan simply moved elsewhere, following their nomadic instincts rather than engaging in endless disputes over whose cattle were grazing on whose land.
The Bantu, however, were there to stay.

Cattle, Kinship, and the Early Economic System
One of the biggest cultural differences between the Bantu and Khoisan was their relationship with property.
The Khoisan believed in sharing‚Äîfood, land, and wisdom. If you had a good hunting day, you shared, knowing that luck might favor someone else tomorrow.
The Bantu believed in ownership‚Äîland was to be claimed, cattle were personal wealth, and power was centralized in leaders who made decisions for the entire community.
Naturally, this led to some awkward conversations: Khoisan: ‚ÄúHow can you own cows? They are living creatures!‚Äù
 Bantu: ‚ÄúYes, and they‚Äôre MY living creatures.‚Äù
Cattle raids became a part-time activity for some, a full-scale tradition for others. The Bantu saw raiding as a test of bravery and skill; the Khoisan saw it as outright theft.
But despite their differences, these two groups learned from each other:
The Khoisan adopted some cattle-herding techniques, realizing that fresh milk was better than chasing an antelope every day. 
The Bantu picked up Khoisan survival skills, learning the secrets of the land, the stars, and natural medicine.
In the end, both cultures influenced each other, blending into the South African identity we know today.

What Can We Learn From This?
‚úÖ South Africa was always diverse. If you think cultural clashes started with colonialism, think again. The Khoisan and Bantu were debating land rights long before Europeans arrived.
‚úÖ People will always fight over resources. Whether it‚Äôs cattle, land, or oil reserves, humans have a long history of saying, ‚ÄúThat belongs to me,‚Äù and the other side responding, ‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚úÖ Our history is a mix of conflict and cooperation. Without the Bantu expansion, the Khoisan might have lived in isolation. Without Khoisan resilience, Southern Africa might have looked very different.
We are here because of both.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üåç Native Americans & European Settlers ‚Äì They had their own land, their own way of life, and then‚Äîships. You can guess how that went.
üá¶üá∫ Aboriginal Australians & British Colonists ‚Äì Like the Khoisan, they lived sustainably for thousands of years‚Äîuntil ‚Äúprogress‚Äù (and some questionable decisions) arrived.
üáÆüá≥ India & Caste Systems ‚Äì While the Bantu had chiefs and cattle wealth, India had kings and ancient social hierarchies. Both systems lasted for centuries and shaped identities in complex ways.

A Story of Adaptation, Not Erasure
The Khoisan and Bantu didn‚Äôt just collide‚Äîthey adapted. Some fought, some traded, some blended. This wasn‚Äôt the end of one people and the rise of another; it was the birth of something new.
And just when they were settling into this uneasy coexistence, new visitors arrived.
Big wooden ships. Strange pale men. And wool coats in the African heat.
But that‚Äôs a story for the next chapter.

Chapter 2: How the Dutch Got Lost, the British Got Greedy, and the Xhosa Got... Involved in Everything

Imagine this: You‚Äôre living your best life‚Äîherding cattle, telling stories by the fire, and enjoying a world where nobody has ever asked you to fill out a tax form.
Then, one day, strange floating objects appear on the horizon.
Not canoes. Not fishing boats. No, these are giant wooden monsters, carrying pale people in strange clothes who look lost but very confident at the same time.
Congratulations, Southern Africa! Your first Europeans have arrived.
And with them, came a whole new era of trade, confusion, conflict, alliances, misunderstandings, and eventually‚Äîbureaucracy.

The Dutch: Looking for Spices, Finding Land Instead
It all started with the Dutch. To be fair, they weren‚Äôt trying to colonize Africa (at first). They were just looking for a shortcut to India, because back then, everyone wanted spices‚Äînot for fancy cooking, but because food preservation was a struggle.
So, the Dutch East India Company sent Jan van Riebeeck to set up a refreshment station at the Cape‚Äîa kind of medieval drive-thru for sailors to pick up fresh food and water before continuing their journey.
But‚Äîas history has taught us‚Äîwhen people say they‚Äôre ‚Äújust passing through,‚Äù they usually end up staying.
What started as a pit stop turned into a settlement, and that‚Äôs when things got interesting.

The Khoisan & Bantu Meet the Dutch: A Mixed Reception
The Khoisan and Bantu, who had been doing just fine without Dutch involvement, were not sure what to make of these new visitors.
On one hand, the Dutch brought useful trade goods‚Äîmetal tools, beads, and fancy clothing (even though wearing thick wool in Africa made no sense).
On the other hand, the Dutch didn‚Äôt seem to understand the local way of doing things.
For example: 
‚úÖ The Khoisan didn‚Äôt 'own' land‚Äîthey moved around, following the seasons. The Dutch saw open space and thought, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take that.‚Äù 
‚úÖ The Bantu saw cattle as wealth, but also as a shared resource. The Dutch saw them as steaks on legs. 
‚úÖ The natives thought treaties were agreements based on trust. The Dutch thought treaties were legal documents that gave them permanent rights.
It wasn‚Äôt long before cultural misunderstandings turned into actual conflicts.

The Land & Private Property Disputes Begin
The Dutch believed in official land deeds, contracts, and fences. The Xhosa believed in cattle wealth, oral agreements, and the simple logic of ‚ÄòInto yomntu yeyam, eyomlungu ndiyayifanisa.‚Äô In other words, private property was a flexible concept‚Äîdepending on who owned it.The Khoisan, on the other hand, believed no one owned land at all. And thus, the great property debates of South Africa began‚Äîa dispute so fierce that centuries later, it would still be shaping policies, protests, and dinner table arguments.
To the Xhosa, cattle weren‚Äôt just wealth; they were walking bank accounts, passed through generations, traded for marriage, or simply taken in daring raids. The Dutch, however, saw ownership as permanent‚Äîland, cattle, and property could be fenced, registered, and inherited according to strict legal codes. The Khoisan, watching this unfold, probably wondered why everyone was getting so worked up over resources that belonged to no one and everyone at the same time.
With each passing year, the Dutch expanded their settlements, pushing the indigenous people further from their ancestral grazing lands. What started as a few farms along the Cape soon turned into frontier wars, cattle raids, and a never-ending argument over who actually owned what.
And as history would have it, the British were about to arrive and make everything even more complicated.

The Afrikaners: A New African Tribe is Born
While the Dutch were busy running their trading post, something else was happening‚Äîtheir descendants were becoming something entirely new.
The Afrikaners (Boers) were not just European settlers anymore. They were farmers, fighters, and in many ways, a new African tribe.
They adapted to local conditions, developed their own language (Afrikaans), and started moving further inland, away from Dutch control.
They lived off the land, just like many African groups, but with a rigid belief in their own distinct identity.
And when the British eventually arrived, they found themselves caught between two worlds‚Äînot quite European anymore, but not fully African either.
This was just the beginning.

The British Arrive: Enter the Redcoats
Just as the Dutch and Afrikaners were settling in, along came the British, who looked at the Cape and thought, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice. We‚Äôll take it.‚Äù
The British were not the 'live off the land' type‚Äîthey were the 'rule from an office' type.
They introduced new laws, new taxes, and a lot of unrequested bureaucracy.
The Afrikaners resented British rule, so they started moving inland‚Äîthe beginning of the Great Trek.
The Xhosa, meanwhile, were already dealing with both Dutch and British expansion, and their resistance would shape the coming conflicts.
And that‚Äôs when things really started to escalate.

The Xhosa: Caught in the Middle, But Always Standing Strong
The Xhosa were not passive bystanders in this unfolding drama.
They traded with the British, fought the British, and sometimes made peace with them.
They negotiated with the Afrikaners, fought the Afrikaners, and sometimes even aligned with them against the British.
They protected their land fiercely, sometimes through diplomacy, sometimes through war, but always with resilience and strategy.
South African history isn‚Äôt just a European story.
It‚Äôs a Xhosa story, an Afrikaner story, a Khoisan story, and a Bantu story‚Äîall colliding in ways that shaped the country‚Äôs future.

What Can We Learn From This?
‚úÖ Nobody planned for things to turn out this way.
The Dutch just wanted a trading post.
The Khoisan just wanted their freedom to roam the land.
The British wanted control but ended up with a resistance movement.
The Xhosa wanted to keep their land and autonomy.
The Afrikaners wanted their own identity and independence.
‚úÖ History is complicated.
The first interactions weren‚Äôt just wars‚Äîthey were also trade, cooperation, and alliances.
Modern South Africa exists because of both conflict and cooperation.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá∫üá∏ The British Were Doing the Same Thing in America. They took land, fought wars, and made a mess of things‚Äîsound familiar?
üáÆüá≥ The British Were Also Colonizing India at the Same Time. They promised trade, brought bureaucracy, and left a giant mess when they finally left.
üá¶üá∫ The Aboriginal Struggle Was Strikingly Similar. Just like the Khoisan, they lived sustainably for thousands of years‚Äîuntil 'progress' (and some bad decisions) arrived.

A Clash That Would Define the Future
By this point, Southern Africa was no longer just a land of ancient traditions and slow migrations. It had become a land of competing interests, colliding cultures, and growing tensions.
And the battle for control?
It was only just beginning.


Chapter 3: How We Went From Animal Skins to Three-Piece Suits in the African Heat

Before colonization, Africans dressed according to climate, culture, and common sense.
The Khoisan wore minimal clothing, because Southern Africa is hot, and walking long distances in thick fabric is not fun.
The Xhosa wore animal skins and beadwork, dressing up or down based on the occasion.
The Zulu had their iconic attire, perfect for battle, ceremonies, and everyday life.
Everything was functional, comfortable, and suited to the African environment. No one was sweating in wool suits or suffering through summer in leather shoes.
Then, Europeans arrived, looked around, and said, ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äîthis won‚Äôt do.‚Äù
And so began The Great Clothing Crusade, where people who clearly didn‚Äôt understand African weather decided to fix a problem that didn‚Äôt exist.

Missionaries, Modesty, and the Madness of Wool in Africa
The first major push for ‚Äúproper‚Äù clothing came from missionaries, who saw bare skin and traditional attire and concluded: ‚ÄúThese poor souls are living like savages! We must save them.‚Äù
Never mind that:
It was 35¬∞C (95¬∞F) in the shade.
The missionaries were the ones sweating in thick robes.
No one asked them for fashion advice.
The missionaries believed that modesty equaled civilization, so they started handing out trousers, dresses, and coats, convincing people that ‚Äúprogress‚Äù meant covering up.
And slowly but surely, African attire started changing.

From Function to Fashion: The New ‚ÄúCivilized‚Äù Look
Once Europeans decided what was ‚Äúproper‚Äù clothing, colonial governments made it official.
‚úÖ Want to work in colonial administration? Suit up.
 ‚úÖ Want to be seen as ‚Äúeducated‚Äù? No more animal skins‚ÄîWestern-style outfits only.
 ‚úÖ Want to be respected? Say goodbye to comfort.
Soon, we had:
‚ÄúSunday best‚Äù outfits‚Äîmodeled after European fashion, even though African ceremonies never required a dress code before.
School uniforms‚Äîbecause apparently, looking identical made learning easier.
Formal work attire‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚Äúprogress‚Äù like sweating through a three-piece suit at midday.
And the worst part? We started enforcing these rules on ourselves.
If you walked into a government office in traditional attire, people looked at you funny.
If you wore Western clothes, you were suddenly seen as more educated.
If you didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúnice‚Äù clothes, you weren‚Äôt just poor‚Äîyou were ‚Äúuncivilized.‚Äù
And just like that, colonialism won‚Äîone outfit at a time.

The Unholy Alliance: Missionaries, Business, and the Textile Industry
Now, let‚Äôs not pretend this was only about morality. There was money involved.
European textile manufacturers saw an opportunity:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Convince Africans their clothes aren‚Äôt good enough.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Introduce ‚Äúproper‚Äù clothes.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sell them those clothes.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ Profit.
It‚Äôs the same trick used today‚Äîwhere the fashion industry convinces people that last year‚Äôs perfectly good clothes are now ‚Äúout of style,‚Äù forcing them to buy new ones.
So, Africans‚Äîwho had dressed comfortably and practically for generations‚Äîstarted spending money on clothes that made no sense for their environment.
Fast-forward to today, and what do we see?
People wearing three-piece suits in scorching heat, sweating for the sake of ‚Äúprofessionalism.‚Äù
Schoolchildren in woolen uniforms, barely surviving summer afternoons.
Entire cultures abandoning their clothing traditions in favor of Western fashion.
And here‚Äôs the biggest joke of all:
The same Western societies that forced Africans into Victorian attire are now practically walking around naked.
Kanye West‚Äôs wife? One strong gust of wind away from a public indecency charge.
Hollywood red carpets? They‚Äôve gone full Khoisan mode‚Äîonly with a higher price tag.
Jeff Bezos‚Äô girlfriend? If the missionaries saw her, they‚Äôd faint on the spot.
So let‚Äôs get this straight:
They made our ancestors suffer through layers of thick clothing in the African heat‚Äîall in the name of ‚Äúcivilization.‚Äù
Now they walk around half-naked, in the miserable weather of London, and suddenly it‚Äôs called fashion.
Somewhere in the spirit world, an old Xhosa elder in a leopard-skin wrap is shaking his head and saying, ‚ÄúWe suffered for NOTHING.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üåé Indigenous Brazilians also had their traditional attire replaced by European fashion standards. Now, if you walk into a Brazilian bank in anything other than a suit, people assume you‚Äôre unemployed‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs 40¬∞C outside.
üáØüáµ Japan modernized in the 1800s, abandoning traditional kimonos in favor of Western suits‚Äîonly to realize later that suits make no sense in humid Japanese summers.
üá≥üá¨ Pre-colonial Nigeria‚Äôs flowing robes were perfect for the heat. Then colonization arrived, and suddenly, tight suits and stiff collars became a status symbol.
üá∑üá∫ Russians, who live in one of the coldest places on Earth, somehow decided their military uniform should include tall furry hats and heavy coats‚Äîwhich looked great, but turned into sweat lodges indoors.
üá¨üáß The British, who made Africa dress ‚Äúmodestly,‚Äù are now fine with celebrities wearing outfits that look like they were stolen from a fishing net.

What Can We Learn From This?
‚úÖ Colonialism didn‚Äôt just take land‚Äîit took fashion sense too. Before colonization, Africans dressed for their environment. After colonization, we were told that only Western clothes mattered.
‚úÖ Marketing and control go hand in hand. The fashion industry still uses the same tactics today‚Äîconvincing people they need things they don‚Äôt.
‚úÖ Irony is everywhere. Europeans forced Africans to wear suits in the heat. Now, they wear shorts and sandals while we sweat through formal wear.





Chapter 4: How They Tried to Convert Us

Before colonialism, bureaucracy, and the invention of the queue at Home Affairs, African people had their own spiritual systems.
The Khoisan had their connection to nature, honoring the spirits of their ancestors and the land they walked on.
The Bantu had their ancestral traditions, believing that the living and the dead were connected, and that wisdom didn‚Äôt come from books‚Äîit came from the elders who had lived through things and had the scars to prove it.
We had healers instead of priests, rituals instead of pews, and a belief system that wasn‚Äôt about controlling people‚Äîit was about guiding them.
Then, the missionaries arrived, looked around, and said:
‚ÄúThese poor souls don‚Äôt know God. We must save them.‚Äù
Now, here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt realize we needed saving.
Just like most healthy people didn‚Äôt think they needed a Covid vaccine, but were told repeatedly that they did.
Just like people living perfectly fine lives are suddenly told they need a life coach, a self-help book, or a ‚Äúseven-step plan‚Äù to be complete.
Just like we didn‚Äôt know we were ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù until the people who barely bathed told us so.
Apparently, what we thought didn‚Äôt matter.
They knew what was best for us.
And so, just like that, we were introduced to the Great Spiritual Upgrade‚Äîwhether we asked for it or not.

The First Attempt at Converting Us: The Guilt Campaign
The missionaries, bless them, had one major strategy: convince us we were sinners, then offer us salvation.
This was not an easy task, because:
We weren‚Äôt exactly feeling guilty.


Unlike Europe, where religious guilt came free with every birth certificate, we didn‚Äôt have concepts like original sin. We believed that if you did good, good would come back to you. If you did bad, well‚Ä¶ the ancestors were watching.
We already had spiritual leaders.


We had sangomas, elders, and wise men and women who handled spiritual matters. So when the missionaries said, ‚ÄúWe bring you the Word of God!‚Äù our ancestors said, ‚ÄúThanks, but we already talked to our ancestors, and they replied.‚Äù
Their rules made no sense.


No dancing? No drumming? No beer at ceremonies? This was like showing up to a wedding and saying ‚ÄúNo one is allowed to celebrate.‚Äù
But the missionaries weren‚Äôt going to give up that easily.

The Second Attempt: Schools and Churches
Realizing that telling us to stop dancing wasn‚Äôt working, the missionaries switched tactics.
They started building schools and churches, with the promise that if we accepted their teachings:
We would become ‚Äúeducated‚Äù (translation: "You will be taught how to follow our system.")
We would be closer to God (translation: "You will do things our way.")
We would be more civilized (translation: "You will abandon your ways and adopt ours.")
And, to be fair, some people did convert.
Not because they suddenly believed European Christianity was better, but because being educated meant getting opportunities, and opportunities meant survival in the new colonial world.
Others converted because mission schools were the only places where you could learn to read and write‚Äîwhich, in a world being taken over by paperwork and laws, was suddenly a very important skill.
So, bit by bit, our traditional ways were being replaced‚Äînot because we were convinced they were wrong, but because the system left us with no choice.

The Third Attempt: The Fear Factor
When education and guilt weren‚Äôt enough, they pulled out the big guns:
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt convert, you will burn in hell!‚Äù
‚ÄúYour ancestors? False gods! You must abandon them!‚Äù
‚ÄúAll your traditions are evil!‚Äù
Picture this: A missionary arrives at a Xhosa village to lecture an elder‚Äîsomeone who's survived wars, droughts, and probably took a knobkerrie to the head back when dodging wooden clubs was the local sport. The missionary's big message? 'Stop talking to your ancestors to reach God... it's dangerous! By the way, have you heard about our main spiritual intermediary? He died about 2000 years ago.'
The elder, who has spent decades connecting with Qamata through time-honored ancestral traditions, sits there trying not to roll their eyes as the missionary explains how communicating with the deceased is strictly forbidden... right before launching into a detailed account of how they personally have a deep relationship with a particular Middle Eastern ancestor from two millennia ago.
The real kicker? The same missionary who's warning about the perils of connecting with spirits is eagerly introducing the concept of a Holy Spirit. The elder probably wished they had that knobkerrie handy just to have something to lean on while processing this particular piece of theological gymnastics."

Christianity in Africa Today: A Mixed Bag
Now, let‚Äôs be fair‚ÄîChristianity isn‚Äôt all bad.
It brought a sense of unity among different African groups, who had to adapt the religion in their own way.
Many Africans today have merged Christianity with their ancestral beliefs, proving once again that we don‚Äôt just accept things‚Äîwe adapt them.
Some churches have become powerful social and political forces, helping communities where governments have failed.
But it‚Äôs also left a few strange contradictions:
People will go to church on Sunday but still visit a sangoma on Monday‚Äîjust in case.
Some African churches now look more ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù than Christian‚Äîcomplete with drumming, dancing, and long ceremonies, proving that our ancestors‚Äô ways never really left.
Some pastors have turned faith into a business, selling everything from holy water to miracle cures for diseases, proving that not all colonizers were European.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá≤üáΩ When the Spanish arrived, they forced Catholicism on the native people‚Äîbut instead of abandoning their gods, the Mexicans just merged Catholic saints with their own deities. Now, they have things like Day of the Dead, where Christianity and ancient traditions mix perfectly.
üáÆüá© was Hindu and Buddhist for centuries before Islam arrived. But instead of completely erasing the old ways, their form of Islam still keeps elements of past traditions, because religion never truly erases culture.
üáØüáµ When Christian missionaries arrived in the 1500s, Japan allowed Christianity for a while, then got tired of them and banned the religion completely for 250 years. Now, Christianity is back, but only 1% of the population follows it‚Äîproving that some countries had stronger boundaries than we did.
üá∑üá∫. The Russian Orthodox Church is one of the oldest Christian institutions, but it still keeps a lot of pre-Christian traditions, showing that even the strongest religions adapt over time.
üá¨üá≠ . Ghanaian churches today are known for their vibrant, energetic worship services, proving that Christianity might have changed Africa, but Africa also changed Christianity.

What Can We Learn From This?
Religious conversion is never just about faith‚Äîit‚Äôs also about power.


The missionaries didn‚Äôt just bring God, they brought European culture, politics, and control.
African spirituality never fully disappeared.


It merged, adapted, and found ways to survive, even in modern Christianity.
Irony is everywhere.


Europeans told us to abandon our ways, yet now, many of them are turning to African spirituality, meditation, and ancestor veneration.





Chapter 5: How School Became a Factory for Workers, Not Thinkers

Before formal schooling, knowledge was passed down through storytelling, mentorship, and hands-on experience. You learned what you needed for survival, leadership, and wisdom‚Äîdirectly from those who had mastered their crafts.
Then came colonization, and with it, a school system designed not to educate, but to produce obedient workers. Thinking was secondary. Compliance was key.

Pre-Colonial Education: Learning by Doing
In African societies, learning was:
Practical ‚Äì You learned farming by farming, healing by healing, and leading by leading.
Community-driven ‚Äì Elders, warriors, and artisans passed down skills to the next generation.
Spiritual and moral ‚Äì Education included values, ethics, and wisdom, not just facts.
There were no classrooms, no rigid schedules‚Äîjust life as the classroom, where everyone contributed to the community‚Äôs survival.
Then came the Europeans, and suddenly, education wasn‚Äôt about learning how to live. It was about learning how to serve.

Colonial Schools: Designed for Obedience, Not Intelligence
Colonial powers needed workers, not thinkers. So, they introduced schools that:
‚úÖ Taught just enough literacy and numeracy to create clerks, not innovators.
 ‚úÖ Emphasized obedience over creativity, punishing questioning minds.
 ‚úÖ Erased indigenous knowledge, replacing it with European history, language, and ideals.
Instead of preparing children to build communities, schools trained them to work in offices, factories, and mines‚Äîfor someone else.
And that mentality never left.

Modern Schooling: A Legacy of Control
Fast-forward to today, and schooling still looks a lot like a colonial training camp:
Memorize, don‚Äôt question.
Pass exams, don‚Äôt think critically.
Follow instructions, don‚Äôt innovate.
The school bell? A relic from factory shifts. Uniforms? A sign of discipline, not individuality. The curriculum? Still shaped by outdated colonial-era frameworks.
Even when people demand better education, they rarely ask: Better for what? Because a system designed for obedience can‚Äôt suddenly produce free thinkers.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üåé Finland ditched standardized testing and ranks among the best in global education.
 üá©üá™ Germany‚Äôs apprenticeships blend hands-on experience with formal learning.
 üá®üá≥ China produces top performers‚Äîbut at the cost of extreme pressure.
 üá∫üá∏ The U.S. system is heavily standardized, yet still struggles with outcomes.

What Can We Learn From This?
‚úÖ School was never designed to empower‚Äîit was designed to indoctrinate and train obedient employees. The traditional formal school model of education still influences the way we learn today.
‚úÖ Real learning happens beyond the classroom. Knowledge that improves life‚Äîskills, creativity, problem-solving‚Äîcan‚Äôt be memorized for a test.
‚úÖ Education needs reform, not repetition. A new model should prioritize critical thinking, adaptability, and real-world skills over outdated traditions.
The question is: Do we want students who comply, or thinkers who challenge the world?



Chapter 6: How We Went From Strong Families to Fatherless Homes‚ÄîAnd Called It Progress

Before: Family Was Wealth‚ÄîNow, It‚Äôs Just an Expense
Before colonization, wealth wasn‚Äôt measured in money.
A family's wealth among the Khoi and San was not measured in accumulated possessions, but rather by the number of strong, healthy children they had to carry on their lineage.
A strong family wasn‚Äôt the one with the biggest house‚Äîbut the one with the strongest bonds and the most stability.
The future wasn‚Äôt secured by bank accounts‚Äîit was secured by the people you raised to carry on the family name.
Then the colonizers came, looked at this system, and said: ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù
They introduced a new system of wealth.
Now, wealth was measured in money, not people.
Now, success was defined by what you owned, not who you raised.
Now, children were no longer an investment‚Äîthey were a financial burden.
And today?
Marriage rates have plummeted.
People are having fewer children‚Äîor none at all.
Developed countries are experiencing a population collapse that threatens their entire economies.
But hey, at least we ‚Äúadvanced,‚Äù right?

How We Went From Valuing Life to Valuing Things
The traditional African family model ensured continuity.
If you had more children, you had more hands to help with work, more people to care for the elderly, and more strength to defend the family.
Extended families meant no one was left alone‚Äîbecause blood ties are permanent.
Fast-forward to today:
People prioritize careers over children.
Elders are abandoned because there are no children left to care for them.
Governments are now panicking over low birth rates‚Äîafter spending decades discouraging large families.
The irony?
Japan, China, and many European nations now have declining populations‚Äîso much that they‚Äôre begging people to have more kids.
China‚Äôs one-child policy created a generational gap they can‚Äôt recover from.
South Korea is now paying people to get married and have babies‚Äîbecause modernity destroyed family culture.
But when Africa had large families, we were called ‚Äúuncivilized.‚Äù

Ukuthwala: The Marriage Practice That Shocked the Colonizers
One of the first customs the Europeans condemned was ukuthwala.
This was not ‚Äúkidnapping,‚Äù as the Europeans claimed‚Äîit was a form of arranged marriage.
A young man who wanted to marry a woman (especially if her family disapproved) could arrange to "take" her to his family.
Negotiations between the families would follow, ensuring she was well cared for.
This practice:
‚úÖ Ensured women married within a stable structure.
 ‚úÖ Gave families control over ensuring their daughters were provided for.
 ‚úÖ Reduced unwanted pregnancies and STDs, since early marriage meant fewer sexual partners.
But the colonizers looked at this structured system and decided it was ‚Äúoppression.‚Äù
So they banned it.
And today?
Women are now ‚Äúfree‚Äù to have children with multiple absent fathers.
STDs and unwanted pregnancies have skyrocketed.
The government is now forced to pay child grants‚Äîfunded by taxpayers.
So remind me again‚Äîwho benefited from banning ukuthwala?

Polygamy: The Safety Net That Westerners Called Barbaric
Before colonization, polygamy wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúmale domination‚Äù‚Äîit was about stability.
1Ô∏è‚É£ No woman was left unprotected or without support.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Men were expected to provide for all their wives and children.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ Women had a built-in support system through co-wives, rather than struggling alone.
But then the missionaries arrived, clutched their Bibles, and declared: ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like that.‚Äù
According to them:
üö® Polygamy was sinful! (Meanwhile, European kings had mistresses and illegitimate children everywhere.)
 üö® Polygamy was oppressive to women! (Meanwhile, single mothers today work three jobs just to survive.)
And so, polygamy was condemned.
The result?
Women are now raising children alone, without financial or emotional support.
Men are still having multiple partners‚Äîbut now, they don‚Äôt have to provide for them.
Instead of co-wives helping each other, single mothers now depend on social grants.
At least now, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcivilized.‚Äù

The Extended Family: When No Child Grew Up Without a Father Figure
In traditional African society, a child was never ‚Äúfatherless.‚Äù
If the father died, uncles stepped in.
If a child was orphaned, the extended family raised them.
Grandparents played a key role in passing down wisdom.
There was no such thing as ‚Äúsingle parenting.‚Äù
But then came the nuclear family model‚Äîimported from Europe.
Now, fathers leave and never come back.
Children are left with mothers who have no support.
Grandparents are dumped in nursing homes instead of being respected elders.
Today, fatherless homes are the leading predictor of crime, poverty, and social instability.
But hey, at least it‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù right?

Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üáØüáµ : One of the most technologically advanced nations‚Äîbut also one of the loneliest. Low birth rates, skyrocketing elderly care costs, and an entire generation too busy working to start families. Now, the government is offering financial incentives for marriage and childbirth.
üá®üá≥ : After decades of enforcing its one-child policy, China is now desperately trying to reverse its population collapse. Too little, too late‚Äîmillions of elderly have no one to care for them, and the workforce is shrinking fast.
üá™üá∫ : Marriage and birth rates are declining across the continent. Countries like Italy and Germany are now offering financial bonuses to people who have children.
üá∫üá∏ : Once the land of big families and strong communities‚Äînow the land of people choosing pets over kids because children are ‚Äútoo expensive.‚Äù Meanwhile, nursing homes are overflowing with abandoned elderly.

Firstborn Sons: The Unseen Burden of Traditional Responsibility
Before colonization, inheritance worked differently.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Women received their share when they got married.
This came in the form of cows, gifts, and resources to start their new household.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Firstborn sons, however, inherited responsibility‚Äînot wealth.
They were expected to manage the family estate‚Äîfor everyone‚Äôs benefit.
They couldn‚Äôt just ‚Äúspend‚Äù the wealth‚Äîit had to be used for current and future generations.
The Europeans looked at this and decided it was unfair‚Äîto women.
So they introduced European inheritance laws, where:
‚ùå The firstborn son no longer had an obligation to care for the family.
 ‚ùå Women were no longer expected to marry for security‚Äîthey could now ‚Äúbe independent.‚Äù
And now?
‚ùå The state, which ironically still collected most of its revenue from men, replaced husbands as the provider for women.
Women still suffer under economic instability.
Elders are abandoned because no one feels responsible for them.
The family unit has disintegrated.
At least now, ‚Äúeveryone is equal.‚Äù

What Did We Gain? What Did We Lose?
Let‚Äôs be fair‚Äîsome good things came from changing marriage customs.
‚úÖ Women gained more legal rights. (Though, ironically, they still suffer the most in modern society when compared to men.)
 ‚úÖ Forced marriages declined. (Which is great‚Äîbut were they really "forced" or just family-arranged for security?)
 ‚úÖ Women got more freedom to choose their own partners. (Which is great, except now, they‚Äôre more likely to end up raising children alone.)
But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwhat did we lose?
‚ùå Family bonds weakened. Women now struggle alone.
 ‚ùå Fatherless homes skyrocketed. Children grow up without discipline or direction.
 ‚ùå Crime increased. Studies prove that fatherless boys are more likely to become criminals.
So remind me again‚Äîwho really benefited from all these ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù changes?

Chapter7: The Illusion of Order‚ÄîHow "Progress" Created Division

Before the British came with their legal systems, the Xhosa had their own way of maintaining order:
Chiefs and elders resolved disputes
Land belonged to the community
Trade happened through cattle and bartering
Then the British looked at this and said: "No, no, no‚ÄîI don't like that."
According to them, we needed:
Written laws instead of oral traditions
Individual land ownership instead of communal living
Money instead of cattle for trade
And so began the great "civilizing mission"‚Äîwhether we wanted it or not.

The Convenience That Became a Trap
Let's be honest‚Äîsome changes were good:
‚úÖ Education opened new opportunities
‚úÖ Railways made travel easier
‚úÖ Modern medicine saved lives
‚úÖ Electricity made life convenient

But here's the twist:
Once we got used to these things, we couldn't go back.
Once our children went to school, they needed jobs.
Once we used money, we needed more of it.
Once we lived in towns, we couldn't just return to tribal life.
The system made us dependent on it‚Äîthen used that dependency against us.

How the English Played Everyone
The British were masters at the game of divide and rule:
1Ô∏è‚É£ First, they fought the Xhosa
2Ô∏è‚É£ Then, they fought the Boers
3Ô∏è‚É£ Then, they made the Boers fight the Xhosa
4Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, they sat back and watched the chaos

Their strategy was brilliant (and terrible):
‚úÖ Give some groups privileges over others
‚úÖ Make everyone depend on their system
‚úÖ Create divisions between people who once lived together
‚úÖ Pretend to be the "civilized" referees in conflicts they created

The Birth of New Tribes
The system didn't just divide existing groups‚Äîit created new ones:
The Afrikaners:
Started as Dutch farmers
Developed their own language and identity
Broke away from British control
Eventually created apartheid to protect their new identity

The "School People" (Amagqobhoka):
Xhosa who embraced Western education
Often looked down on traditional ways
Created a new elite class among Africans
Sometimes helped enforce colonial rules

The "Red People" (Amaqaba):
Those who kept traditional ways
Resisted Western influence
Were often marginalized by both systems
Struggled to maintain their identity

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World...
üáÆüá≥: The British used the same divide-and-rule tactics, turning princes against each other
üá®üá≥: Foreign powers carved up the country into "spheres of influence"
üá∫üá∏: Native Americans were forced onto reservations "for their own protection"
üá¶üá∫: Aboriginals were classified by blood percentage, dividing families
üá≥üáø: The Maori signed a treaty that meant one thing in English and another in their language

The System That Created Its Own Resistance
The more "order" they imposed:
‚ùå The more people fought to participate in the system they now depended on
‚ùå The more educated Africans demanded equal rights
‚ùå The more the Afrikaners wanted independence from British control
‚ùå The more complex the laws became to maintain control

From Segregation to Apartheid
The road to apartheid didn't start in 1948‚Äîit started with:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Glen Grey Act of 1894: Which limited land ownership
2Ô∏è‚É£ The Native Land Act of 1913: Which restricted where we could live
3Ô∏è‚É£ The Native Urban Areas Act of 1923: Which controlled our movement
4Ô∏è‚É£ The Natives Representation Act of 1936: Which removed voting rights

What Did This "Order" Really Create?
Let's be honest about what happened:
‚úÖ We got education‚Äîbut it came with cultural erasure
‚úÖ We got modern convenience‚Äîbut lost independence
‚úÖ We got "civilization"‚Äîbut lost our ways of maintaining order
‚úÖ We got progress‚Äîbut it came with oppression

The Final Irony
The system that was supposed to bring order:
Created new tribes instead of uniting people
Made everyone dependent on it while excluding most from its benefits
Turned neighbors into not only strangers but enemies
Created resistance from the very "progress" it brought

Because at the end of the day, true order doesn't come from imposing one system over another.
It comes from respecting that different people can have different ways of creating order.


Part 2
Chapter 8: The Rainbow That Came With a Storm

Once upon a time, South Africans believed in miracles.
We believed that 1994 meant the start of true equality before the law.
We believed that democracy would bring opportunity for all.
We believed that politicians had our best interests at heart.
For a brief moment, it felt like we had made it.
People hugged in the streets.
The national anthem was rewritten to include everyone.
The world praised us as a symbol of peace and reconciliation.
But here‚Äôs the thing about rainbows: they only come after a storm‚Ä¶ and sometimes, another storm follows.

The Rainbow Dream: What We Were Told Would Happen
In 1994, South Africa promised itself a fresh start.
Apartheid was gone.
Discrimination was over.
We were all equal before the law, no matter our race or sex.
At least, that‚Äôs what the Constitution said.
For a moment, it actually seemed like we were moving forward.
Black and white South Africans worked together, studied together, and built businesses together.
The country opened itself to foreign investment, trade, and opportunity.
The world saw us as a model of reconciliation.
But while ordinary South Africans were busy shaking hands and singing the new national anthem, politicians were cooking up something else entirely‚Äîa new racial division, but this time, with a business model.
While most of us got stuck on the ‚Äúequal before the law‚Äù part of the Constitution, thinking it meant unity, the politicians were flipping pages like seasoned con artists, landing on the fine print: the redress provision.
We saw democracy. They saw a loophole.
We saw equality. They saw race hustling as a long-term investment strategy.
And before we knew it, BEE, race quotas, and preferential policies became the foundation of a new elite class.

How the Rainbow Was Stolen
It didn‚Äôt take long before the new government realized something important:
A united South Africa didn‚Äôt benefit them.
If people saw each other as equals, they wouldn‚Äôt vote based on race.
If people worked together, they wouldn‚Äôt need politicians to ‚Äúfix‚Äù things for them.
If people stopped focusing on apartheid, they might start noticing government corruption instead.
So, they did what all politicians do best:
They made sure the past never left.
They made sure racial and sex division remained useful.
They made sure blame could always be shifted.
Because if you keep people fighting each other, they won‚Äôt notice that you‚Äôre robbing them blind.
And that‚Äôs exactly what happened.

From Liberation Movement to Looting Movement
Let‚Äôs compare.
Then (Apartheid Government, Flawed But Functional)
Government was oppressive, but at least it functioned‚Äîtrains ran, power stations worked, and infrastructure existed.
It was unjust, but at least it wasn‚Äôt completely incompetent.
Now (ANC Government, Free But Failing)
Government is ‚Äúfor the people,‚Äù but the people are unemployed, starving, and watching corruption get worse.
It is ‚Äúdemocratic,‚Äù but somehow, the same people keep getting re-elected despite failing.
It is ‚Äúequal,‚Äù but policies still prioritize race and sex over competence.
And worst of all?
It is ‚Äútransparent,‚Äù yet money disappears faster than you can say ‚ÄúState Capture.‚Äù
At this point, we need to ask:
Did we get freedom, or did we just get new masters with different surnames?

The Economy of Racial Division: Keeping the Past Alive for Profit
BEE, affirmative action, and racial quotas became a billion-rand industry of corruption, incompetence, and political favoritism.
Competent people were pushed out in favor of politically connected individuals.
Government contracts are awarded not to the best companies, but to the best bribe-payers.
State-owned enterprises have been looted in the name of ‚Äútransformation.‚Äù
And yet, every time things got worse, the government had the same excuse:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs apartheid‚Äôs fault.‚Äù
Eskom fails? Apartheid.
Crime increases? Apartheid.
Billions stolen from taxpayers? Apartheid.
Millions of currency found in Phala Phala?  Apartheid.
At some point, you have to ask:
Is apartheid running the government from the grave?

The Biggest Lie: ‚ÄúFree‚Äù Things
One of the biggest post-1994 myths was that government could provide for the people.
Housing? Free! (If you don‚Äôt mind waiting decades for an RDP house that might collapse before it‚Äôs even allocated to you.)
Education? Free! (But quality? That costs extra.)
Electricity? Free! (Unless you actually expect it to work.)
But here‚Äôs the problem:
Nothing is free.
The government has no money‚Äîit only has taxpayer money.
And the more the government "gives," the more it takes from those who actually work.
And guess who funds it all?
Men and Minorities. (Who contribute the most in personal income tax, yet benefit the least.)
White South Africans. (Who are legally excluded from many government opportunities, but never from paying tax.)
Business owners. (Who are told they must ‚Äúgive back‚Äù , as if providing services and employment was not enough, while the government takes everything.)
Meanwhile, the biggest beneficiaries are:
Women. (Who are prioritized in jobs, education, and business, funded by tax money that comes mostly from men.)
Black South Africans. (Who receive exclusive tax funded support, while white taxpayers are expected to fund it without complaint while benefiting the least)
Politicians. (Who promise ‚Äúempowerment‚Äù but somehow end up empowering only themselves and their friends.)
And here‚Äôs where it gets ridiculous:
There is no program that excludes women from benefiting‚Äîbut there are many that exclude men.
There is no law that prevents black people from paying tax‚Äîbut there are laws that prevent white people from benefiting.
This is not justice.
This is just a redistribution scheme disguised as progress.
At this point, the only truly equal opportunity left in South Africa is the opportunity to be robbed and murdered.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá∫üá∏ : The land of ‚Äúequality,‚Äù where government gives race-based scholarships while pretending to be colorblind.
üáÆüá≥ : A country where caste-based reservations ensure that some groups get priority jobs and education‚Äîjust like BEE.
üá≥üá¨ : A democracy where leaders steal billions, blame colonialism, and keep getting re-elected.
üá∑üá∫ : A place where government critics disappear, proving that South Africa isn‚Äôt THAT bad (yet).
üáßüá∑ : A country that fought for democracy, only to end up with leaders who steal as much as the dictators before them.
Zimbabwe: A reminder that bad governance can collapse a country faster than any external enemy.

What Can We Learn From This?
Racial division benefits politicians, not ordinary people.


White and black South Africans are both suffering under ANC misrule.
The only ones winning? The corrupt elite.
Free things aren‚Äôt free‚Äîsomeone always pays.


Government has no money‚Äîit only has taxpayers‚Äô money.
The more the government ‚Äúgives,‚Äù the more it takes from those who actually work.
Merit matters more than race or sex.


Hiring based on race and sex instead of skill is why we have a skills shortage.
It‚Äôs why we import artisans and engineers while locals remain unemployed.
At some point, we need to admit:
It‚Äôs not apartheid that‚Äôs holding us back anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs bad governance.


Chapter 9: How We Traded Practical Skills for Useless Papers and Still Ended Up Unemployed

Once upon a time‚Äîbefore democracy, bureaucracy, and BEE quotas‚ÄîSouth Africa had an education system that, while far from perfect, at least made sure people could do something useful.
During apartheid, education was deeply unequal‚Äîbut the government, for all its injustices, at least believed in practical skills.
Schools and colleges trained artisans, mechanics, electricians, and factory workers.
If you had a skill, you had a job.
Then democracy arrived, and the new government‚Äîdetermined to erase everything associated with the past‚Äîdecided that practical education had to go too.
Technical colleges? Downgraded.
Trade schools? Underfunded.
Factories that once employed thousands? Shut down.
In their place? A system that prioritized ‚Äúacademic excellence‚Äù over actual competence.
The result?
There are countless graduates who can eloquently discuss critical race theory but struggle to support themselves without taxpayer support.
We produce PhD holders who are unemployed, while we import welders, mechanics, and electricians from other countries.
The same government that killed technical skills is now crying about a "skills shortage"‚Äîas if it wasn't their own doing.
Somewhere in 1994, a government official must have stood up in a meeting and said:
"Let‚Äôs destroy everything that works, and then complain when nothing works!"
And everyone else nodded.

When Education Was About What You Could Do
Let‚Äôs compare.
Then (Apartheid Education System, Flawed But Functional):
Education was unequal, racist, and unfair‚Äîlet‚Äôs not sugarcoat it.
BUT, the people who went through the system could at least work.
Technical skills were prioritized‚Äîif you were trained in something, you could prove your ability by actually doing it.
Factories, industries, and trades flourished because practical skills were valued.
Now (Democratic South Africa‚Äôs Education System):
Education is ‚Äúequal,‚Äù but it produces unemployable graduates.
Degrees, not skills, are prioritized‚Äîbecause writing a thesis is apparently more important than fixing the country‚Äôs electricity grid.
Instead of training local artisans, we now import them‚Äîpaying foreign workers to do the jobs our own people should be doing.
And somehow, the unemployment rate just keeps getting worse.
At this point, you have to ask:
Did we really improve education, or did we just create a more expensive way to produce useless workers?

Degrees vs. Skills: The Great Lie
Somewhere along the way, someone convinced South Africans that the key to success was getting a degree.
Not skills. Not experience. Not real-world ability.
No‚Äîjust a piece of paper.
And what happened?
People started chasing degrees instead of skills.


‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what I study, as long as I have a degree!‚Äù
And so, we produced thousands of graduates in fields that have no jobs.
People started faking degrees.


Because let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîskills can‚Äôt be faked, but a qualification can.
Some people just memorized the final answers. Others? Straight-up bought their degrees.
Meanwhile, people with no degrees but actual skills thrived.
The farmer is growing food and feeding himself and the country.
The builder and carpenter is creating homes to house families.
The unemployed graduate is still "waiting for an opportunity."
At some point, we have to admit that we‚Äôve been scammed.

The Government‚Äôs Role: Breaking What Worked and Complaining About It
When the democratic government took over, they had the perfect opportunity to fix what was broken.
They could have kept the technical skills system, while making it accessible to all races.
They could have built more trade schools, training centers, and industries.
They could have created an economy where EVERYONE had a chance to succeed.
But instead?
They shut down functioning schools and factories, then introduced ‚Äúoutcomes-based education,‚Äù which failed spectacularly.
They pushed university degrees as the only path to success, ignoring the need for artisans and technicians.
Now, they spend billions on importing the very skills they killed off.
The worst part?
They still don‚Äôt see the irony.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá©üá™ : They never fell for the ‚Äúeveryone needs a degree‚Äù scam. Instead, they have one of the best vocational training systems in the world‚Äîwhich is why their economy thrives while ours struggles.
üáßüá∑ : They realized their universities were producing too many unemployed graduates, so they invested in trade schools‚Äînow, their skilled workers are thriving.
üá∑üá∫ : The West thought sanctions would cripple Russia, but instead, it adapted and thrived.
Russia maintained its technical schools, ensuring there were always skilled workers to build and sustain the country.
Even as Western companies left, Russia developed local alternatives and redirected trade to Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
While other economies struggle with outsourcing, Russia doubled down on industrial and technical expertise, proving that self-sufficiency matters more than foreign approval..
üá®üá≥ : They train millions of workers in both academic and practical skills, which is why they manufacture everything while we struggle to fix potholes.
üáÆüá≥ : They have some of the best engineers and IT professionals in the world‚Äîbut they also train millions in hands-on trades.

What Can We Learn From This?
A degree does not equal success.


If it did, we wouldn‚Äôt have so many unemployed graduates.
Skills, experience, and adaptability matter more than a piece of paper.
Practical education is more important than theoretical learning.


A plumber doesn‚Äôt need to write a 40-page thesis on pipes.
An electrician doesn‚Äôt need a dissertation on volts and watts.
They just need to do the job well.
We destroyed technical skills‚Äîand we are paying the price.


We now have a ‚Äúskills crisis‚Äù that didn‚Äôt exist before.
We import welders, engineers, and artisans instead of training our own people.
Instead of fixing the problem, we just create more committees to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù it.
At some point, we need to stop pretending.


Chapter 10: How the Criminals Get Free Meals While the Victims Pay the Bill)

Once upon a time, justice was swift, simple, and actually worked.
In precolonial times, crime was personal. If you stole, you repaid double‚Äîor risked exile. If you killed, the victim‚Äôs family decided your fate.
During apartheid, crime was low‚Äînot because people were angels, but because the police were feared. You didn‚Äôt want to end up in prison making bricks for the government.
Then democracy came, and suddenly, criminals got more rights than their victims. The police became underfunded, prisons became rehabilitation centers, and convicted murderers got to go on parole‚Äîsometimes to commit murder again.
South Africa didn‚Äôt just stop punishing criminals‚Äîit started rewarding them.
You get free food.
You get free healthcare.
You get a chance at parole.
Meanwhile, your victim gets trauma, legal fees, and possibly a funeral.
At this point, we need to ask:
Are we running a justice system, or a government-sponsored criminal internship program?

Justice Before vs. Now: A History of Decline
Let‚Äôs break it down.
1. Precolonial Justice: Swift, Personal, and Logical
Before prisons, courts, and legal loopholes, justice was handled at the community level.
Crime was dealt with by the people who suffered from it, or at least with their input on the punishment.
If you stole, you repaid‚Äîplus extra, as an apology.
If you killed, you either made amends with the family or faced their wrath.
If you were a repeat offender, you were cast out‚Äîexiled if not killed, forgotten, done.
There was no prison, no parole, no tax-funded meals.
Justice was fast. No five-year trials, no endless appeals.
Justice was fair. If you harmed someone, you faced the community.
Justice made sense. If you stole from your neighbor, you didn‚Äôt get free food‚Äîyou were expected to fix the damage.
And most importantly, criminals had to make amends to the victim‚Äînot to the government.
Now? Victims get nothing while criminals get three meals a day, free exercise, and sometimes a law degree.

Apartheid Justice: Brutal, But Effective
Let‚Äôs be clear: Apartheid‚Äôs laws were racist, unjust, and cruel.
But if you committed a crime‚Äîyou paid for it.
The police were feared. They didn‚Äôt play games. If you got caught, there was no political speech about your ‚Äúchildhood struggles‚Äù‚Äîyou went straight to jail.
Prison was actual punishment. Inmates built roads, made bricks, and worked for the state.
The death penalty was real. If you killed, you got killed back‚Äîsimple.
And what was the result?
Crime was lower.
Prisoners actually worked to pay for what they consumed.
Criminals weren‚Äôt considered victims of society‚Äîthey were just criminals.
Was the racial discrimination of the system unfair? Yes.
 Was it corrupt? Yes.
 Did it work better than what we have now? Also yes.
Because at least criminals weren‚Äôt treated like VIP guests at a taxpayer-funded resort.

Democratic Justice: Where Criminals Have More Rights Than Victims
Then came 1994, freedom, and the dream of justice for all.
We ended the death penalty.
We introduced parole‚Äîeven for violent criminals.
We made prison life comfortable with free food, education, and healthcare.
And what happened?
Crime exploded.
Police became underfunded and ineffective.
Prisons became ‚Äúrehabilitation centers‚Äù  that instead created hardened criminals.
And somehow, the first president of this new democracy was an ex-convict.
Not a coincidence.
Not a fluke.
It set the tone for everything that followed.
Now, being a criminal isn‚Äôt a failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a potential career path.

The ANC: Leading by Example in Criminality
It‚Äôs no wonder crime is high‚Äîour leaders do it too.
Ministers steal billions, then give speeches about fighting corruption with a straight face.
Jacob Zuma and Tony Yengeni were too sick to serve their full sentences‚Äîuntil they were miraculously healed by parole and seen playing golf and dancing.
The Minister of Justice is under investigation for a dodgy VBS loan‚Äîbut don't worry, the case will probably disappear faster than state funds.
The president was found with cash stuffed under his couch, yet somehow, he‚Äôs still in office.
ANC politicians looted COVID-19 relief funds, meant for the sick and dying, proving that even a global pandemic couldn‚Äôt slow down their corruption.
If the leaders are looting the country dry, why should the criminals on the street behave any differently?
At this point, you have to ask: Who‚Äôs the real gang? The guys in prison, or the guys in parliament?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá∫üá∏ : Under the Biden-Harris administration, shoplifting under $1,000 is a misdemeanor. Criminals walk into stores, take what they want, and leave. Employees are told not to stop them.
üá¨üáß: The nation that once ruled through "law and order" now shows us five fascinating ironies:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The police have stopped investigating "minor crimes" like burglary and theft because they're "too busy"‚Äîbut they have plenty of time to arrest people for social media posts. The same nation that created complex systems to control colonies now can't control basic crime in their own streets.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Once exported their legal system across the globe claiming it was the most advanced‚Äînow their courts are so backlogged that victims wait years for justice, while "hate speech" cases get fast-tracked through the system.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Used to send police across the empire to "maintain order"‚Äînow their police are too afraid to stop actual crime in certain areas because it might appear "culturally insensitive." The empire that once policed the world can't even police its own neighborhoods.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Created detailed racial classification systems in their colonies‚Äînow claim they're "colorblind" while their own statistics show massive racial disparities in arrests and convictions. The difference? They just don't talk about it anymore.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Once proud of their "British values" and imposed them on others‚Äînow struggle to define what those values are, while arresting citizens for "causing offense" online. The nation that taught us about freedom of speech now polices jokes on Twitter.

What Can We Learn From This?
Justice used to be swift, but now it‚Äôs a business.


Lawyers get rich, criminals get chances, and victims get nothing.
Criminals have more rights than law-abiding citizens.


Free food, free housing, free education‚Äîall while taxpayers suffer.
If crime pays more than honest work, why would anyone stop?


Politicians steal billions and stay in power.
Criminals go to prison and get out early.
Meanwhile, victims are left to rebuild their lives alone.
At some point, we need to stop pretending:
This is not justice. This is a scam.


Chapter 11: How Taxes Turned Helping People into a Soulless Transaction Instead of a Moral Duty
For most of human history, helping others wasn‚Äôt just about charity‚Äîit was about logic, reciprocity, and maintaining order.
Families took care of each other‚Äînot because they had to, but because it made sense.
Communities supported their members‚Äînot blindly, but with expectations of good behavior.
Help wasn‚Äôt just given‚Äîit was earned.
If you were struggling, your family stepped in.
A father helped his son get back on his feet.
A brother supported his unemployed sibling‚Äîbut only if that sibling wasn‚Äôt a lazy bum.
A community fed a struggling family‚Äîbut if that family disrespected the community, they‚Äôd find themselves on their own.
This wasn‚Äôt cruelty‚Äîit was discipline.
Help was given, but only to those who deserved it.
Assistance was temporary, not a lifelong handout.
Moral responsibility was enforced‚Äîif you broke trust, you lost support.
Then the government stepped in, took one horrified look at voluntary charity, and said: 
üö® ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äîthis won‚Äôt do.‚Äù üö®
Suddenly, helping people became mandatory, impersonal, and completely detached from morality.
You don‚Äôt get to choose who you help.
You don‚Äôt get to demand that they change their behavior.
You just get taxed‚Äîand if you refuse, you go to jail.
At this point, we need to ask: Are we supporting the poor, or are we just financing laziness and bad decisions?

The Logic of Family Support vs. The Absurdity of Government Welfare
In Families, Help Comes With Conditions
If a family member falls on hard times, they receive help.
If they‚Äôre unemployed, they get support‚Äîbut they‚Äôre also expected to be actively looking for work.
If they struggle with addiction, they get a second chance‚Äîbut not an unlimited supply of free money.
If they repeatedly steal from the family or refuse to change, eventually, they are cut off.
The system is simple:
You contribute, you receive.
You take advantage, you‚Äôre out.
In Government Welfare, There Are No Strings Attached
Now let‚Äôs compare that to how government "help" works.
Are welfare recipients required to give back to the community? No.
Are they required to prove they‚Äôre making an effort to improve? No.
Can they keep receiving benefits while committing crimes, refusing to work, and making no effort to contribute? Yes.
At this point, it‚Äôs no longer assistance‚Äîit‚Äôs a reward for failure.
And who funds it all?
The productive citizens who actually work.
The people who pay taxes, only to get nothing in return.
It‚Äôs one thing to help someone in need.
It‚Äôs another thing to be forced to support strangers who contribute nothing, with no accountability.

What Happens When There‚Äôs No Moral Obligation to Improve?
When families help each other, there‚Äôs an unspoken rule:
If you mess up, you get a second chance. If you mess up again, you‚Äôre out.
A father might take in his unemployed son, but if that son refuses to work, he‚Äôs eventually kicked out.
A community might support a struggling member, but if they keep stealing from neighbors, they‚Äôre exiled.
A wayward child might be given another shot‚Äîbut only if they show genuine remorse and effort.
This is why traditional systems worked.
Help was a safety net, not a lifestyle.
Assistance was temporary, not an entitlement.
People were held accountable for their actions.
Now? Government assistance has none of these controls.
A person on welfare can refuse to work‚Äîand still get paid.
A criminal can get social grants‚Äîwithout being required to make amends to their victims.
Entire generations can grow up on government support‚Äîwithout ever learning the value of self-reliance.
And what happens?
A culture of entitlement replaces a culture of responsibility.
People expect handouts, but feel no duty to give back.
People demand free services, but don‚Äôt care about their own communities.
People live off the system, but contribute nothing to it.
And the ones who actually work, build, and contribute?
They get taxed into the ground to fund the very people who refuse to help themselves.

The Tax Scam: How Many Times Can They Take Your Money?
Here‚Äôs how the government makes sure they take everything from you:
You learn a skill. (If you study at a university, you pay VAT on tuition fees.)
You get a job. (You immediately start paying income tax.)
You buy a house. (You pay property tax.)
You buy food. (You pay VAT.)
You put petrol in your car. (Almost half the price is tax.)
You die. (Your assets get taxed again.)
And somehow, we‚Äôre supposed to believe this is fair.
If you risk your money to start a business and succeed, you‚Äôre punished with a heavy tax bill.
If you risk everything and fail, you get nothing.
So in success, they‚Äôre waiting to take their cut.
In failure, they don‚Äôt care.
If that‚Äôs not extortion, what is?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá∫üá∏ : People demand free healthcare, free college, and free everything‚Äîwhile drowning in $33 trillion of national debt.
üá¨üáß : High taxes, but somehow, even their police officers are struggling to afford food.
üá≥üá¨ : The government steals everything, so people just bribe their way through life instead of paying taxes.
üáÆüá≥ : If you don‚Äôt pay tax, the government just shrugs‚Äîbecause enforcement is a joke.

What Can We Learn From This?
Government welfare is not charity‚Äîit‚Äôs forced wealth redistribution.
You don‚Äôt get to choose who you help.
You don‚Äôt get to demand responsibility from them.
Real help comes with accountability.
In families, help is earned.
In government welfare, help is given with no strings attached.
If taxes are so great, why do they have to be forced?


If people truly believed in paying tax, they wouldn‚Äôt have to be threatened with prison.
At some point, we need to stop asking:
"Where is my tax money going?" because we know it's going towards funding corruption.
And start asking:
"Why am I still paying it?"


Chapter 12: The Rat Race
Once upon a time, life was about family, community, and survival.
The Khoisan hunted and gathered, moving with the seasons.
The Bantu farmed, traded, and lived in tight-knit villages.
The Xhosa worked the land, raised cattle, and passed wisdom through generations.
Yes, life had challenges, but at least people lived it.
Then, modernity arrived, took one horrified look at people simply living their lives, and said: üö® ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äîthis won‚Äôt do.‚Äù üö®
Suddenly, the goal was no longer to live‚Äîbut to work.
First, we were sent to school for 12+ years, memorizing facts we‚Äôd forget immediately after exams.
Then, we were told to get degrees (even if they were useless).
Next, we got jobs where we worked 9‚Äì5, Monday to Friday, for 40+ years.
Finally, we were allowed to retire‚Äîjust in time to realize we were too old to enjoy life.
And somehow, they called this progress.

The Modern Life Formula: Work, Pay, Die
Here‚Äôs how life works now:
Spend the first 12+ years in school.


Sit in a classroom learning abstract things you‚Äôll never use.
Spend your youth preparing for a job you might never even get.
Get a job and work until your 60s.
Wake up early. Sit in traffic. Work for 8+ hours. Sit in traffic again. Sleep. Repeat.
Have two days off a week, where you recover just enough to do it all over again.
Save for retirement (if you‚Äôre lucky).
If you somehow survive, you can finally relax‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶only to find out inflation has eaten your savings, or your pension was looted, and your body is too old to enjoy anything.
At this point, you start to wonder:
Did we really progress, or did we just turn life into a long, unpaid internship for the grave?

The Xhosa, Khoisan, and Bantu Had This Figured Out
The irony is, our ancestors already knew what we forgot.
The Khoisan didn‚Äôt spend their lives chasing money or materialistic possessions‚Äîthey spent it with family and nature.
The Xhosa didn‚Äôt separate education and work from life‚Äîthese were part of life.
The Bantu didn‚Äôt sit in offices‚Äîthey built through trade, farming, and craftsmanship, but knew when to rest.
Compare that to now:
We wake up before sunrise to rush to work.
We spend the best years of our lives in offices, staring at screens.
We spend decades paying off a house, a car, and a lifestyle we don‚Äôt even have time to enjoy.
And the worst part?
By the time we retire, we realize that we spent our entire life‚Ä¶ waiting to live.
At this point, you have to ask:
Is this a life‚Äîor just a really long self-inflicted punishment?

Modern Life: More Work, More Stuff, Less Fulfillment
Let‚Äôs break it down:
People are more educated than ever, but less innovated and also more broke than ever.


You can have a degree, a job, and still be struggling to afford groceries.
People are working longer hours, but getting less in return.


The corrupt get richer, while the working class stays trapped in survival mode.
People are postponing life for ‚Äúlater‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but later may never come.


We tell ourselves: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll travel when I retire.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll spend time with my family when I have time.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll rest when I‚Äôm old.‚Äù
Then one day, we wake up, and we‚Äôre old.
At this point, we need to admit:
The rat race isn‚Äôt life‚Äîit‚Äôs just a very slow, very exhausting way to die.

Why Are We Doing This? Because They Lied to Us.
From childhood, we were told:
‚ÄúGo to school, work hard, get a degree, and you‚Äôll be successful!‚Äù
‚ÄúGet a job, and you‚Äôll be secure!‚Äù
‚ÄúSave for retirement, and you‚Äôll enjoy your old age!‚Äù
Now, reality is:
People with degrees are unemployed.
Jobs don‚Äôt guarantee security.
By retirement, you‚Äôre either broke, sick, or both.
And if you still have your retirement savings intact, count yourself among the fortunate few. 
And somehow, we‚Äôre still telling kids the same lie.


The Ultimate Proof of Success: The Ability to Survive and Continue
But let‚Äôs take this even further.
Forget billionaires. Look at nature.
What is the most basic definition of success for any living being? Survival.
A species is successful if it can reproduce and continue through generations.
An individual is successful if they can pass on their genes and ensure their offspring survive.
And in that regard?
I am here. You are here.
Which means: Our ancestors succeeded.
They lived long enough to have children.
They raised those children well enough that they could have their own.
They adapted, survived wars, famines, and crises.
They made it‚Äîwithout PhDs, without corporate jobs, without the rat race.
That is the ultimate proof that success is not measured by money, degrees, or corporate titles.
Because in the end?
The real winners are those who continue, not those who accumulate.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üáØüáµ : Work so hard that companies have a word for ‚Äúdeath by overwork‚Äù (karoshi).
üá®üá≥ : Where "996" (9am-9pm, 6 days/week) is considered normal, and they call it "blessing" to work yourself to death. 
üá∞üá∑ : Where "kkondae" culture means young workers are stuck between respecting hierarchy and actually getting work done. 
üáÆüá≥ : Where engineers code by day for Silicon Valley, sleep by night in Mumbai, and dream of moving to Canada. 
üá¨üáß : Where people commute 2 hours to London for jobs they hate, to pay mortgages they can barely afford. 
üá∏üá¨ : Where "kiasu" culture means your kid needs 3 tutors by age 5 just to keep up with the neighbors.

What Can We Learn From This?
A job is just a way to survive‚Äîit‚Äôs not a life.


If you‚Äôre spending all your time working, when do you actually live?
The system is built to keep you running, but never winning.


The rich work less and make more. The rest work more and make less.
If you have to wait until retirement to enjoy life, you‚Äôve already lost.


Why wait until you‚Äôre old to start living?
At some point, we need to ask:
Is there another way?



Chapter 13: How ‚ÄúA Better Life for All‚Äù Became ‚ÄúAt Least You‚Äôre Not Zimbabwe‚ÄùIn 1994, the ANC stood before South Africa like a sweet-talking salesman selling a miracle product.
‚ÄúVote for us, and we‚Äôll give you jobs!‚Äù (Now, unemployment is over 30%.)
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give you free electricity!‚Äù (Eskom went from world-class to world‚Äôs biggest joke.)
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give you free education!‚Äù (But we‚Äôll remove the quality, so degrees are useless.)
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll provide free housing!‚Äù (RDP houses that collapse faster than the promises made to build them.)
It all sounded too good to be true.
Because it was.
Fast forward to 2025, and the only thing South Africans have received for free is load-shedding, crime, potholes, and a front-row seat to government corruption.
At this point, you have to wonder:
Was this incompetence or just a well-executed scam?

The Problem With ‚ÄúFree‚Äù
The moment a government says ‚Äúthis is free,‚Äù alarm bells should go off.
Nothing is free. Someone is always paying for it.
The government has no money. It only has taxpayer money.
If something is ‚Äúfree,‚Äù you are either paying for it through taxes or getting a downgraded, broken version.
South Africans believed the fairy tale that services could be free‚Äîand now we‚Äôre living in the horror movie where nothing works.
Here‚Äôs what was promised vs. what we actually got:
Free Electricity? We Got Load-Shedding.
The ANC promised every home would have electricity.
Instead, we have rolling blackouts, broken power stations, and diesel shortages.
Meanwhile, Eskom executives still get bonuses.
Free Water? We Got Water Shortages.
We were told ‚ÄúWater is a basic right!‚Äù
But somehow, municipalities forgot to maintain pipes, and now taps run dry.
Meanwhile, politicians have bottled water at their meetings.
Free Housing? We Got Corrupt Tenders.
The ANC promised millions of houses.
Instead, they gave tenders to their friends, and those friends disappeared with the money.
Meanwhile, thousands are still waiting for homes 30 years later.
Free Education? We Got Unemployable Graduates.
They said ‚ÄúEducation will uplift the nation!‚Äù
But instead, they dumbed down the curriculum, removed practical skills, and produced a generation of graduates who can write essays on Karl Marx but can‚Äôt find a job.
Meanwhile, we import skilled workers from other countries.
Free Healthcare? We Got Dysfunctional Hospitals.
The government said ‚ÄúHealthcare for all!‚Äù
Now, state hospitals don‚Äôt have medication, equipment, or even working toilets.
Meanwhile, politicians fly to private hospitals (or overseas) when they get sick.
At this point, the only thing truly free in South Africa is disappointment.

The Irony: The People Who Were Promised the Most Got the Least
Here‚Äôs the sad reality:
Poor South Africans‚Äîwho were promised a better life‚Äîare still waiting.
Rich South Africans‚Äîwho were told they‚Äôd be punished‚Äîare the only ones still keeping the economy running.
Let‚Äôs break it down:
The unemployed were promised jobs‚Äîbut the government destroyed industries that provided jobs.
The poor were promised support‚Äîbut government officials stole the money meant for them.
The middle class was told they‚Äôd pay more tax‚Äîbut that tax money funds corruption, not services.
And now?
The rich have left.
The middle class is shrinking.
The poor are worse off than before.
At this point, it‚Äôs not apartheid that‚Äôs holding people back‚Äîit‚Äôs the people who lied about fixing it.

Where Did the Money Go?
Every year, the government collects billions in taxes.
But somehow:
Roads are still full of potholes.
Trains don‚Äôt work.
Schools are crumbling.
Hospitals are a disaster.
Where did the money go?
To luxury mansions for politicians.
To ‚Äúconsulting fees‚Äù for government friends.
To international shopping trips disguised as government ‚Äúconferences.‚Äù
South Africa didn‚Äôt run out of money.
The money was stolen.

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üá∑üá∫ : Corrupt but at least they know how to keep the lights on.
üá¨üáß : High taxes, but at least the trains work, sort of.
üá∫üá∏ : ‚ÄúFree‚Äù healthcare debate still going on, but at least McDonald‚Äôs is always open.

What Can We Learn From This?
"Free" always comes at a cost.


If the government offers something for free, expect higher taxes, lower quality, or outright failure.
South Africa doesn‚Äôt have a lack of money‚Äîit has a lack of accountability.


Corruption is the reason we have no water, no electricity, and no jobs.
The people who believed the lies the most have suffered the most.


Poor South Africans were used as voting blocks, not as people to uplift.
At some point, we need to stop pretending:
Apartheid isn‚Äôt the reason the taps are dry.
Apartheid isn‚Äôt the reason Eskom is failing.
Apartheid isn‚Äôt the reason RDP houses are falling apart.
Corruption is.
And if we don‚Äôt fix it, the only thing we‚Äôll ever get for free is more failure.


Chapter 14: How We Traded Lifelong Bonds for Temporary Transactions and Called It Progress

For most of human history, people didn‚Äôt rely on governments, corporations, or international charities for survival.
They relied on kinship.
They relied on close-knit communities.
They relied on people who had a permanent interest in their well-being.
This system worked not because people were kinder back then, but because they were logical.
You invested in your family because your family would always be there.
You helped your neighbor because you knew your neighbor would help you when you needed it.
You looked out for your community because your survival depended on it.
And most importantly:
You didn‚Äôt help just anyone.
You didn‚Äôt help a stranger passing through the village‚Äîyou helped the people who were going to be there tomorrow.
When we helped strangers passing through it was because they earned our trust and gave us hope that if we were in the same position they would reciprocate.
You didn‚Äôt give money to someone who would take it and disappear‚Äîyou invested in people you could hold accountable.
You didn‚Äôt waste resources on those who refused to contribute‚Äîyou helped those who had proven they would give back.
This is why kinship-based support systems worked.
Blood ties are permanent.
Community ties are stable when immigration is low.
People help each other, knowing that the favor will be returned‚Äînot out of charity, but out of necessity.
Then, modernity arrived.
And suddenly, we were told that kinship was outdated, community was unnecessary, and that a government-run social welfare system was the ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù way to help people.
Now, here we are‚Äîwith a society where people don‚Äôt even know their neighbors, but somehow, they‚Äôre forced to pay for their healthcare and housing.
At this point, we need to ask:
Did we really advance, or did we just turn personal responsibility into a government-funded Ponzi scheme?

Kinship-Based Help: The Original Social Security System
1. Family Support: The Most Reliable Investment
Kinship works because it has built-in accountability.
A father provides for his children, knowing that one day, those children will take care of him.
A sister helps her brother through hard times, knowing that he will do the same if she ever needs it.
A village supports a struggling family, knowing that this family will contribute once they recover.
Unlike government welfare, family support is not a one-way transaction.
There are no anonymous recipients.
There is no blind redistribution.
There is no risk that the recipient will disappear and never give back.
Because at the end of the day:
Blood doesn‚Äôt expire.
Even if your father is old and weak, he is still your father.
Even if your brother moves away, he is still your brother.
Even if you die, your descendants are still part of your family line.
This creates a system of obligations that lasts for generations.
Compare that to modern welfare systems, where the government takes your money and gives it to complete strangers‚Äîmany of whom will never repay it, never contribute to society, and never even acknowledge the sacrifice you made.
At least in a family system, you know who you‚Äôre helping, why you‚Äôre helping them, and what they will do in return.
In a government system, you just fund an endless pit of welfare recipients with no accountability.

Community Support: Trust Over Transactions
Even outside of blood ties, tight-knit communities functioned on the same principles.
People invested in each other‚Äînot because they were kind, but because they had to.
If a man needed help building his house, his neighbors helped‚Äîknowing that he would do the same for them.
If a woman lost her husband, the community supported her‚Äîknowing she would contribute in other ways.
This worked because everyone had an interest in keeping the community stable.
Now? Communities barely exist.
People don‚Äôt even know their neighbors.
Towns and cities are full of strangers who have no loyalty to one another.
Instead of trusting each other, people trust government programs run by bureaucrats who don‚Äôt even live in their communities.
At this point, we replaced trust with transactions‚Äîand we wonder why society is falling apart.

How Modernity Replaced Kinship With Cold, Impersonal Transactions
Modern society told us that helping family and community members was ‚Äúbackward‚Äù and ‚Äúlimiting.‚Äù
Instead, they gave us:
Government Welfare


A system where taxpayers are forced to support strangers, with no guarantee that those strangers will ever contribute back.
No moral obligation, no social responsibility‚Äîjust a government middleman taking money from one group and giving it to another.
Corporate Charity


Companies ‚Äúdonate‚Äù to causes‚Äînot because they care, but for PR.
They give billions to anonymous strangers instead of helping the people who actually make their businesses run.
Anonymous Giving


The rise of GoFundMe, disaster relief funds, and international aid has made people feel like they‚Äôre doing something‚Äîeven though they‚Äôll never see where the money actually goes.
And the biggest problem?
There is no accountability.
There is no obligation to contribute back.
There is no permanent bond between the giver and the receiver.
We were told this was progress.
But what we really did was turn human relationships into meaningless, short-term transactions.

The Debt We Owe Each Other: What David Graeber and Thomas Sowell Got Right
Anthropologist David Graeber explains in Debt: The First 5,000 Years that in traditional societies, debt was more than just money‚Äîit was about obligations, relationships, and reciprocity.
When someone helped you, you owed them‚Äînot in money, but in loyalty.
Debt wasn‚Äôt about immediate repayment‚Äîit was about long-term relationships.
Breaking your obligations meant breaking trust with your entire community.
Economist Thomas Sowell adds that functional societies operate on incentives.
People contribute because they know they will get something in return.
If you remove accountability, people stop contributing.
Welfare without responsibility destroys both the giver and the receiver.
Now, think about this in the context of modern taxation and welfare:
Taxpayers fund a welfare system that rewards failure, with no expectation of improvement.
Families no longer feel obligated to help each other‚Äîbecause ‚Äúthe government will do it.‚Äù
People who contribute the most are punished the most, while those who contribute nothing are rewarded.
And somehow, we call this progress.

What Can We Learn From This?
Kinship-based support systems work because they have built-in accountability.


You help those who will help you in return.
You don‚Äôt waste resources on people who refuse to contribute.
Communities thrive when people invest in those who will still be there tomorrow.


You don‚Äôt invest in strangers‚Äîyou invest in your own.
Replacing kinship with government welfare has destroyed personal responsibility.


Now, people expect handouts with no effort.
Now, taxpayers are forced to support strangers they‚Äôll never meet.
At some point, we need to stop pretending that this system works.
Because if we don‚Äôt fix it, we‚Äôll end up with a society where nobody owes anyone anything‚Äîexcept taxes.
And right now?
That‚Äôs exactly where we‚Äôre headed.



Chapter 15: The Universal Paradox of Progress
We Were Promised a Lot‚Ä¶
‚ÄúModernization will make life easier!‚Äù (Yet somehow, we‚Äôre busier than ever.)
‚ÄúTechnology will set us free!‚Äù (But we‚Äôre more controlled than ever.)
‚ÄúGovernment will take care of everything!‚Äù (And yet, nothing works properly.)
And here we are.
We have more education, but we‚Äôre dumber than ever.
We have more ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù but we‚Äôre more restricted than ever.
We have more wealth, but we‚Äôre poorer than ever.
We have more convenience, but we‚Äôre more miserable than ever.
At some point, you have to stop and ask: Was it all worth it?
Because if progress really worked, shouldn‚Äôt we all be happier by now?

The Cycle of Civilization: Why We Keep Repeating History
History is funny. Every civilization follows the same cycle‚Äîand somehow, we never learn from it.
1Ô∏è‚É£ We start as self-sufficient tribes. Small, strong, and connected. Everyone plays a role. Life is tough, but meaningful.
 2Ô∏è‚É£ We build kingdoms and empires. We create rules, systems, and governments. Life gets easier.
 3Ô∏è‚É£ We develop massive bureaucracies. People stop providing for themselves. Government grows. People get lazy.
 4Ô∏è‚É£ We get too comfortable. We start focusing on luxury, convenience, and entertainment. We stop paying attention.
 5Ô∏è‚É£ Corruption spreads. The government stops working. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer.
 6Ô∏è‚É£ Collapse. The empire falls, and the cycle starts again.
From Ancient Rome to modern America, from the Zulu Kingdom to today‚Äôs South Africa, the same pattern repeats.
Every civilization thinks they‚Äôve mastered progress, and every civilization eventually collapses under its own weight.
So here‚Äôs the real question:
Are we at step 5‚Ä¶ or already at step 6?

The Irony of Modern Life
The more we ‚Äúadvanced,‚Äù the more we lost the things that actually made life good.
‚úÖ We got formal education‚Äîbut lost practical knowledge.
 ‚úÖ We got democracy‚Äîbut lost community leadership.
 ‚úÖ We got welfare‚Äîbut lost self-sufficiency.
 ‚úÖ We got globalization‚Äîbut lost culture.
 ‚úÖ We got science‚Äîbut somehow, we still believe influencers over actual facts.
Every ‚Äúsolution‚Äù created a new problem.
And the best part?
We keep calling it progress.

But Is It All Bad?
Before you think I‚Äôm saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go back to living in huts and hunting with spears,‚Äù relax.
Some things actually did improve:
‚úÖ Medicine is better, sort of, until you're told to take a vaccine for something that barely affects you. At least we don‚Äôt die from simple infections anymore. (Though, considering modern hospital service, that might change‚Äîjust ask the patients in the Eastern Cape hospitals where the ceilings are collapsing, or those in Tembisa where a whistleblower was assassinated for exposing corruption.)
‚úÖ Communication is faster. We can talk to someone across the world instantly. (Yet, we‚Äôve never felt more disconnected. The loneliest countries on Earth‚ÄîJapan, South Korea, the UK‚Äîare also the most ‚Äúdeveloped.‚Äù Somehow, millions of people can talk instantly but still have no one to turn to.)
‚úÖ Technology makes life easier. We don‚Äôt have to fetch water from a river or fight a lion for dinner. (Of course, that‚Äôs assuming technology actually works. And if you live in South Africa, Eskom ensures that‚Äôs never a guarantee.)
So, yes, progress has its benefits.
But here‚Äôs the catch:
When progress comes at the cost of meaning, community, and independence‚Äîdoes it still count as progress?
Because if you can have a house, a car, and an iPhone, but you‚Äôre still overworked, lonely, and miserable‚Ä¶
Are you really better off than your ancestors?

Meanwhile, Elsewhere in the World‚Ä¶
üèõ Rome Thought It Was Too Advanced to Fail‚ÄîThen It Collapsed.
 The Roman Empire had roads, aqueducts, democracy, and a booming economy. Then they got lazy, corrupt, and obsessed with luxury. Sound familiar?
üåè China Was the Most Advanced Civilization in the World‚ÄîThen It Got Conquered.
 For centuries, China had the best technology, richest cities, and strongest economy. Then they got comfortable and ignored the rest of the world. Europe arrived with guns, and the rest is history.
üóΩ America Said Capitalism Would Save Everyone‚ÄîNow Half the Country Is in Debt.
 The "Land of Opportunity" became the land of student loans, medical debt, and a shrinking middle class. But hey, at least they have Netflix.
See the pattern yet?

So, What‚Äôs the Real Answer?
Maybe the secret isn‚Äôt choosing between modernity and tradition. 
After all, there is nothing so good no bad can come of it, just like there is nothing so bad it's devoid of any good.
Maybe the real solution is balance.
Imagine a world where:
‚úÖ We have modern technology‚Äîbut still grow our own food.
 ‚úÖ We have education‚Äîbut still learn practical skills.
 ‚úÖ We have governments‚Äîbut still solve problems as communities.
 ‚úÖ We use electricity‚Äîbut still know how to survive without it.
Because **progress is good‚Äî**but only if it doesn‚Äôt take away the things that actually matter.

The Final Question: Where Do We Go From Here?
We‚Äôre at a crossroads.
We can either:
‚ùå Keep pretending that everything is fine.
 ‚ùå Keep paying taxes for services that don‚Äôt work.
 ‚ùå Keep working ourselves to death, hoping it will all magically fix itself.
Or‚Ä¶
‚úÖ Start thinking differently.
 ‚úÖ Take the good from modern life without losing the wisdom of the past.
 ‚úÖ Learn to be more self-sufficient.
 ‚úÖ Take responsibility for our own communities.
 ‚úÖ Stop waiting for governments to fix things, because they won‚Äôt.
History shows that civilizations rise and fall.
But maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîif we learn from the past, we won‚Äôt have to repeat it.

Final Thoughts: The Progress Paradox
This is the paradox of progress:
It promises freedom‚Äîbut often creates dependence.
It makes life easier‚Äîbut often makes people weaker.
It brings new solutions‚Äîbut often creates new problems.
So, as we move forward, we must ask:
Are we truly progressing, or are we just running in circles, waiting for history to repeat itself?
The answer?
That‚Äôs up to us.











Epilogue: So‚Ä¶ This Was Progress?

And here we are.
After centuries of colonization, segregation, struggle, and democracy, we were supposed to arrive at a utopia.
We were promised:
üö® ‚ÄúEducation will uplift everyone!‚Äù (Now we have PhD holders who can‚Äôt find jobs and high school dropouts who run billion-rand corruption schemes.)
üö® ‚ÄúDemocracy will give power to the people!‚Äù (Unless those people are taxpayers‚Äîthen their only power is to keep paying for everything while the government delivers nothing.)
üö® ‚ÄúThe free market will bring prosperity!‚Äù (Unless, of course, you‚Äôre trying to start a business and get drowned in red tape, BEE policies, and taxes that punish success.)
üö® ‚ÄúModern life is better than ever!‚Äù (Tell that to the people stuck in traffic, living paycheck to paycheck, or trying to survive another Eskom blackout.)
So‚Ä¶ was it all worth it?
That‚Äôs the paradox of progress. It gives, and it takes.
We got medicine, but we lost traditional healing.
We got modern jobs, but we lost self-sufficiency.
We got democracy, but we lost accountability.
We got technology, but we lost community.
And yet, after all these struggles, wars, and revolutions, we‚Äôre still left with the biggest question of all:
Are we actually better off than our ancestors?

But Don‚Äôt Worry‚ÄîThere‚Äôs More
This book is only the beginning of our journey through the paradox of progress.
In the next book‚ÄîCivilized, Struggling, and Still Confused: The Side Effects of Progress‚Äîwe‚Äôll explore how democracy, globalization, and modern economics have left us with‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say, "mixed results."
We‚Äôll ask why the people who pay the most tax get the least benefits.
We‚Äôll explore why crime is now treated as a social experiment rather than a punishable offense.
We‚Äôll dive into how ‚Äúmodern‚Äù values have led to collapsing birth rates, loneliness epidemics, and the rise of self-help gurus who charge thousands to tell people the same advice their grandmothers used to give for free.
We‚Äôll analyze how first-world countries‚Äîafter forcing their systems on Africa‚Äîare now struggling with the same problems they told us they had solved.
And, of course, we‚Äôll do it with the same satire, humor, and brutal honesty as this book.
Because if history has taught us one thing, it‚Äôs this:
üö® Every civilization believes they‚Äôve reached the peak of progress‚Äîuntil reality hits them in the face. üö®

Final Thought: The Real Lesson of Progress
The truth is, progress isn‚Äôt always forward.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs sideways.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs two steps forward, three steps back.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs just a government official stealing the money that was supposed to fund it.
But at the end of the day, the real challenge is not rejecting progress‚Äîit‚Äôs deciding what progress actually means.
So, until the next book‚Äîkeep questioning, keep thinking, and keep laughing.
Because if you don‚Äôt, the madness of modern life might just drive you crazy.

The End.
