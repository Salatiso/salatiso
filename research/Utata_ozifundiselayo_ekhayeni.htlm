Intshayelelo.

Ingcamango yemfundo yasesikolweni iye yendela kwibutho labantu kangangokuba abanye bakulungele ukuyiyalela ngemithetho. Le ngcamango icebisa ukuba abafundisi-ntsapho, abalawuli nabezobupolitika bafanele benze isigqibo ngemfundo yabantwana bethu endaweni yabazali. UMthetho osayilwayo we-BELA ugrogrisa ulawulo lwabazali kwimfundo yabantwana babo ngokwenza ukuba amandla okwenza izigqibo abe kwindawo eyodwa.

Abezopolitiko bazenza ngathi baxhalabele impilo-ntle yabantwana ukuze bafumane iivoti. Izifundiswa ezixhaswa ngemali yinkxaso yabarhafi ziqinisekisa ezi ngcamango, kwaye abantu abaqeshwe njengeengcaphephe kunye neengcali bafumana inzuzo ngokusasaza iingcamango zezopolitiko ababasebenzelayo, kubandakanywa nekharityhulam yesizwe. Iinqobo ezisemgangathweni zemveli kunye nolwazi oludluliselwe kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana azihoywa ngenxa yokukhetha iingcamango ezinenkqubela.

Ube yintoni umphumo?

Mzantsi Afrika ngonyaka angamashumi amabini anesithathu, unentswela-ngqesho ephezulu, izinga lolwaphulo-mthetho, kunye nabafumana izibonelelo zezentlalo ngaphezulu kwabahlawuli berhafu. Iinkonzo zikarhulumente namaqumrhu karhulumente ayasilela, izikolo namaziko emfundo ephakamileyo athwaxwa ngamahlazo orhwaphilizo, kwaye nezempilo azithembekanga.

Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni ishiye ilizwe linezigulo ezininzi eluntwini nangona liqhayisa ngesona sizukulwana sifunde kakhulu. Ezi ngxaki zisisiphumo sezimvo ezixhasayo ezibeka phambili imfundo esesikweni ngaphezu kokuthatha inxaxheba kwabazali. Inkqubo iye yasilela, nto leyo eyandikhokelela ekubeni ndifune iindlela ezizezinye zemfundo yabantwana bam.

Ndiyavuma ukuba indlela yam isenokungasebenzi kumntu wonke, kodwa ikratshi elithatha imfundo esesikweni ifanele wonke umntu ibangele umonakalo omkhulu. Ukuba iziphumo ezincumisayo xa umntu emdala azikho ngenxa yemfundo esisiseko, kutheni sichitha ixesha nemali eninzi kuyo kwaye sincama ixesha elixabisekileyo nabantwana bethu?

Ndiyala ukufundisa abantwana bam inkqubo yesikolo engaphumeleliyo, ngokungathi yeyona ndlela inye. Sonke siphuma kwizinyanya ezithe, kude kube mva nje, zingazange zifundise abantwana babo ngendlela esesikweni kodwa endaweni yoko bagxile ekufundiseni abantwana babo ekhaya ngokungacwangciswanga.

Ndikuqonda oku, ndiye ndafunela usapho lwam amanye amathuba.
Icandelo lokuqala: Kutheni?
Inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni.

Imfundo yasekhaya yindlela ehlonitshwa ixesha yokufundisa abantwana. Yandulela imfundo emiselweyo kuzo zonke iinkcubeko kwaye ibonisa umnqweno womzali wokukhokela imfundo yomntwana wakhe kwikhaya losapho. Le ndlela yokufundisa ayinikezeli nje kuphela ulwazi oluyimfuneko, izakhono, kunye neenqobo ezisemgangathweni kwimfundo ethe kratya, ingqesho, nobulungu obusebenzayo boluntu, kodwa ikwabonelela nokuguquguquka nokufikelela kwizibonelelo zokufunda ezahlukeneyo.

Imeko yembali yemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika isinika ukukhanya kwisithethe esindele nzulu seentsapho kunye noluntu olungabahlohli abaphambili babantwana, lubanika izakhono eziyimfuneko ukuze baphile negalelo loluntu. Ukuzinikela kule mfundo kwakuqhutywa ngumdla wokwenene wokuxhobisa abantwana ngezakhono zokusebenza, nto leyo eyathi yaneziphumo ezibonakalayo kusapho nakuluntu ngokubanzi. Nakwimeko yamaziko asesikweni kunye noqeqesho olucwangcisiweyo, ukubaluleka kweenkqubo zemfundo ezingekho sikweni kuhleli kucacile.

Utshintsho olusuka kwimfundo engacwangciswanga ukuya ekuqalisweni kwemfundo emiselweyo, ekuqaleni kusetyenziswa izikolo zabavangeli basemazweni, luye lwavelisa iindidi ngeendidi zamaziko emfundo akhoyo namhlanje. Nangona kunjalo, ukubaluleka kwembali nenkcubeko yemfundo yasekhaya kunye neenkqubo zemfundo ezingekho sesikweni zisebenza njengesikhumbuzo esinyanzelisayo sonxibelelwano olunzulu phakathi kwemfundo noluntu, olufikelela ngaphaya kwemida yokufunda elungiselelwe iziko.

1.1. Ukuthelekiswa kwezikolo zikaRhulumente nezabucala.

Inkxaso-mali nobunini bumisela ukuba ngaba isikolo sesikarhulumente okanye sabucala. Izikolo zoluntu, okanye izikolo zikarhulumente, zifumana uninzi lwenkxaso-mali yazo kubahlawuli berhafu, ngelixa izikolo zabucala zixhaswa ngemali ngabazali.

Izikolo zikarhulumente ezibonelela abantu abangathathi ntweni zisimahla kubo, kwaye kufuneka zamkele bonke abafundi, nokuba ithini na imeko yezemali okanye uphononongo lwezifundo zabo. Ezi zikolo zihlelwe ukuqala kwi Quantum 1 ukuya kwi Quantum 3.

Izikolo zikarhulumente ezibhatalisayo ziqala kwi-Quantile 4, ezona zibiza kakhulu ebazalini zikwi Quantile 5, eyokugqibela. Zona zinokukhuphisana nezikolo zabucala eziphezulu kuba zinezibonelelo ezaneleyo ezivela kwimirhumoi eziziqokelelayo.

Izikolo zabucala zisebenza ngokuzimeleyo kurhulumente kwaye zinokubonelela ngenkolo ethile okanye ukhetho lwemfundo. Izikolo ezibizayo, ezibhekiselele kuzo zombini izikolo zabucala kunye nezikolo zikarhulumente ezihlawulisa kakhulu kwi-quantile 5, zithi zifundisa imfundo ekumgangatho ophezulu ukuthethelela amaxamiso aphezulu kuzo.

Zombini izikolo zikarhulumente nezikolo zabucala zijolise ekuboneleleni ngemfundo, ngendlela eqhelekileyo ebandakanya ukuya kwindawo yezakhiwo zesikolo, zinexesha lokungena nokuphuma, ezineeshedyuli ezimiselweyo kunye nekharityhulamu. Ukufunda kude kuyenye indlela ebikade iyinzuzo ngokwembali kubantu abadala abasebenzayo abafuna ukuqhubela phambili ngemfundo yabo besuka kude, kwaye i-intanethi iye yatshintsha le ndlela ngokuvumela ukuhamba bukhoma kwiiklasi ezikude, okwenza inkqubo yokufunda ifikeleleke ngakumbi kubafundi bayo yonke iminyaka.

1.2. Ukuthelekiswa kwezikolo ezisemthethweni, imfundo ekude kunye nokuzifundisela ekhaya.

Kubalulekile ukugxininisa ukuba zombini izikolo ezisemthethweni kunye ne-intanethi zibonelela ngomxholo wemfundo ofanayo, zahluke kuphela kwindlela ezizinikezela ngayo. Ezinye izikolo zikarhulumente nezabucala ezisesikweni ziye zahlanganisana ukuze zinike ezinye zeeklasi zazo kwi-Intanethi, ngakumbi ukusukela oko kwavalwa ngo-2020 xa ukufikelela kumasango esikolo kwakusikelwe umda.

Imfundo ekwi-Intanethi, ekwabizwa ngokuba kukufunda kude, akufuneki ibhidaniswe nokufunda ekhaya. Abafundi abafunda besekhaya okanye kuyo nayiphi na enye indawo basalandela ikharityhulam yesikolo esekiweyo kwaye babambelele kwikhalenda yesikolo kunye neshedyuli yemihla ngemihla, abazali bedlala indima ebonakalayo, njengakwizikolo zikarhulumente okanye kwizikolo zabucala.

Imfundo yasekhaya yahlukile kwisikolo sasekhaya, esilandela imodeli yemfundo esesikweni. Kwisikolo sasekhaya, abazali bathabatha uxanduva lokuhlela nokuvavanya, bethatha le misebenzi endaweni katitshala.

Imfundo yasekhaya inika abazali indima enkulu njengabahlohli baseprayimari, inika ukuguquguquka ngakumbi ngokwekharityhulam. Izixhobo ze-Intanethi kunye nabathengisi babonelela ngezinto eziyimfuneko, iiklasi ezirekhodiweyo okanye eziphilayo, kunye nezixhobo zokuvavanya ukuxhasa abazali kule ndima.

Izikolo ezisesikweni zihlala zijamelana nokugxekwa ngokungaqapheli izakhono ezizodwa zomfundi ngamnye ngenxa yendlela yazo eqhelekileyo. Kulapho ikharityhulam ye-eclectic ingena khona. Le kharityhulamu yobuqu ibhetyebhetye kakhulu kwaye isebenzisa iindlela ezahlukeneyo zokufundisa ukukhawulelana neemfuno kunye nezinto anomdla kuzo umntwana ngamnye.

Ikharityhulam ye-eclectic iyavuma ukuba abazali kunye namalungu entsapho banokuqonda okusondeleyo ngabantwana babo. Iimpawu zabo ezizodwa zibenza babe ngabafundisi abafanelekileyo kwimisebenzi ethile, beyila amava okufunda omntu ngamnye. Kanye njengokuba abantwana bezuza njengelifa iimpawu zokwenyama kubazali babo nakumalungu entsapho, bakwazuza njengelifa iimpawu zobuntu ezinokuphembelela iindlela zokufunda abazikhethayo.

Xa kucingwa ukuba abazali namalungu entsapho anokuhlola ubuchule bomntwana ngokusekelwe kwindlela akhuliswe ngayo, imizila yemfuza nobuchule bakhe, bafanele babe nendima ebalulekileyo ekuxonxeni ikharityhulam.
Kwakutheni ukuze ndiqalise.
Ingxaki yezemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika iphinde yavela kwakhona ngo 2023, idiza ukuba ngaphezu kwamashumi asibhozo epesenti yabafundi bebanga lesine bayasokola ukufunda ukuze bafumane intsingiselo. Olu gcino-manani lothusayo lukhutshwe ngo 2021 lweNkqubela kuFundo loLwazi lokuFunda nokuBhala lwaMazwe ngaMazwe (PIRLS) lufuna ingqwalasela engxamisekileyo. Imeko enkenenkene yokufunda phakathi kwabantwana abafunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezixhaswa yirhafu ngokufanelekileyo baye bafumana iindaba ezibanzi kumajelo eendaba, kweli lizwe nakumazwe ngamazwe. Imeko eqhubekayo yokungakwazi ukufunda kakuhle kule minyaka idlulileyo ayinakubethwa ngoyaba, njengoko igxininisa imfuneko engxamisekileyo yezisombululo ezisebenzayo nezizinzileyo zokuphucula inkqubo yemfundo yeli lizwe. Lixesha lokuba urhulumente, ingakumbi uMphathiswa weMfundo esiSiseko, athathele ingqalelo ngokupheleleyo kwaye asombulule imiba ethe gqolo eqhubayo ukuba nefuthe kwikamva labantwana baseMzantsi Afrika.

2.1. Iingxaki ngenkqubo yesikolo esesikweni.

Imiba ejongene nenkqubo yezikolo emiselweyo eMzantsi Afrika ibonakala ngaphandle kwesidingo sokuphonononga uphando lwezifundo. Urhwaphilizo lugqugqisile, luphambukisa izibonelelo ezikolweni kwaye lunceda umntu ngamnye. Ngaphezu koko, umgangatho weziseko zophuhliso uhlala uphantsi, kwaye ezinye izakhiwo ziye ziwohloke phambi kokuba zigqitywe. Ngaphaya koku, imingeni yoluntu efana nolwaphulo-mthetho, ukufudukela kwabantu ezidolophini, kunye nentswela-ngqesho iqhubela phambili kwidabi lecandelo lezemfundo.

Le miba inefuthe elithe ngqo ekuqeshweni kwabathweswe izidanga, kwaye izinga lentswelo-ngqesho kulutsha lwaseMzantsi Afrika liphezulu ngokumangalisayo. ISebe leMfundo ePhakamileyo lichonge ukunqongophala kokuqonda ukufunda” njengeyona ntsilelo iphezulu yezakhono kwimarike yezemisebenzi.” Nangona iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko linombono woluntu oluphumelelayo nolunedemokhrasi, inyaniso ikude lee kulo mbono.

Inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo exhaswa ngerhafu isebenzise kakubi izibonelelo zabarhafi yaza yaqhubela phambili iyantlukwano yoluntu. Ubume obusisinyanzelo bemfundo yasesikolweni yaphunyezwa ngolawulo lowiso-mthetho, njengoko uMgaqo-siseko ungayichazi imfundo esesikweni njengeyona ndlela yokubonelela ngemfundo esisiseko. Oku kuthandabuza ukuba semthethweni kokunyanzelwa kwabantu kwinkqubo yemfundo.

2.2. Izikolo zikarhulumente zeprayimari nezikolo zabucala zisisicombululo, akunjalo?

Ukwanda kweengcebiso zabakhweli bobuhlanga kugxekwa kanobom liZiko loBudlelwane bobuhlanga (IRR), elijolise ekubhentsiseni izenzo zala makhwekhwetha." Ipesenti encinci yamaxhala kubemi baseMzantsi Afrika, kunye nemiba efana nentswela-ngqesho, ulwaphulo-mthetho, iimeko zokuhlala, kunye nemfundo exhalabisa kakhulu.

Ingcamango yokuba izikolo ezikumgangatho ophantsi ziphezulu ngokwemvelo kunezikolo zikarhulumente ezikumgangatho ophantsi nayo iyathandabuzeka. Nangona amaziko emfundo enomsila esenokubonakala enegalelo elibonakalayo ekufundiseni ngemfundo ekumgangatho ophezulu, kuya kuba bubudenge ukuthi amanani awo aphumeleleyo aphezulu ngenxa yempumelelo yawo kuphela. Oku kungenxa yokuba la maziko abakhetha ngononophelo abafundi bawo phambi kokuba bamkelwe kwaye abeke nemiqobo yezemali. Ke ngoko, kubalulekile ukuvuma ukuba impumelelo yabo ayinakuvunywa kuphela ngenxa yokufaneleka kwabo.

Ngaphezu koko, izityholo zocalucalulo ngokobuhlanga kwizikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu ziye zakhokelela kuphando olubiza imali eninzi, ekugqibeleni lusilele ukuvelisa ubungqina obuxhasa la mabango. Ukongeza, imfundo karhulumente neyabucala ichatshazelwa ziimeko zentlalo noqoqosho kunye nemigaqo-nkqubo yokunikwa kwabo amathuba okuba babonelelwe, ngokuncipha kokufaneleka njengeyona ndlela iphambili yokuqesha kuwo omabini amacandelo kunye nokungakwazi ukuyekisa abasebenzi abangakwaziyo ukwenza umsebenzi ngenxa yeziphumo zomthetho.

Kwakhona amava obuqu ayayiphikisa ingcamango yokuba ukuya kwizikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu kuqinisekisa impumelelo. Nangona ndifunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezingenazibonelelo, mna, kunye noontanga bam, siphumelele inqanaba lempumelelo kunye nomgangatho wobomi ocel' umngeni uluvo lwezikolo ezikumgangatho ophezulu njengenzuzo epheleleyo.

Lo nto ibangele ukuba ndizibuze ukuba yintoni ekhokelele kwimpumelelo yam nangona ndifunda kwizikolo ezinqongopheleyo? Ezi ngcamango zixhokonxa ingcinga zicela umngeni kwiinkolelo eziqhelekileyo malunga nemiba yobuhlanga kunye nokuphakama kwezikolo ezihloniphekileyo, zibonelela ngombono onyanzelisayo kwizinto eziyinyani ezinefuthe kwimpumelelo kwimfundo nakwimisebenzi yobungcali.
Ngaba inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni iyavakala okanye yeza ingqondo?

Ukuba awuzange uphonononge izinto ezingaphaya kwezi zifundiswa zizikolo okanye ungene ezincwadini ngaphandle kofundo olufunekayo, uyaphoswa kokona kubalulekileyo kwehlabathi. Uninzi lwabantu lucwangcisiwe nje, alufundanga ngenene, ukucacisa ngenye indlela isithethi esiphambili sehlabathi kunye nombhali uNicky Verd.

Xa ndikhangela emva kumava am, ngoku ndiyakwazi ukuvakalisa iimvakalelo zam zokwenene ngesikolo. Andizange ndikubuze ukuya esikolweni ndisengumntwana. Kwakungokwemvelo njengokuphefumla okanye isibhakabhaka nomhlaba, okanye ke ndafundiswa ukuba ndikholelwe. Kwakuyimfuneko ukuze uphile, into ongenakukwazi ukuba noluvo ngayo. Noko ke, ekubeni ngoku ndinenkululeko yokubuza nokucinga, ndiyaqonda ukuba ndandingasithandi isikolo. Okumangalisayo kukuba, iirekhodi zam zemfundo zinokucebisa ngenye indlela. Inyaniso kukuba, ndagqwesa ezifundweni kuba ndandifuna ukubaleka ngokukhawuleza kangangoko ndandinako. Kwasebuncinaneni bam, bendisoloko ndiziva ndikhululekile xa ndikwikhaya lam. Ngoko, ngoxa isikolo sasinikela uhlobo oluthile lokufunda, ngokufuthi sasivakalelwa njengohlobo oluthile lokuthuthunjiswa.

3.1. Izinto ezingavakaliyo ngemfundo yasesikolweni.

Ngaba indlela yokufundisa yezikolo esesikweni yeyona ilungileyo kubafundi abohlukeneyo? 

Ekukhuleni kwam, kwakufuneka ndihambe imigama emide xa ndisiya esikolweni, ndijamelene nemozulu embi kunye neengozi. Ubukhulu becala ndandifunda ngokuphulaphula ootitshala nokufumana iimpendulo eziyimizekelo kwiimviwo. Ukucinga okunzulu akuzange kukhuthazwe.

Imisebenzi yezemidlalo yayisisinyanzelo, nokuba ayiyonwatyiswa okanye ayidingeki. Ugonyamelo lwaluxhaphakile, phezu kwazo nje iinkolelo zokuba imidlalo yayinokunceda ekupheliseni utyekelo lwethu lokuba ndlongondlongo njengamakhwenkwe aselula.

Izikolo zazibonwa njengezona mithombo ziphambili zokhathalelo lwabantwana xa abazali besebenza, kodwa xa kuqwalaselwa izinga lentswela-ngqesho elandayo namhlanje, oku akusenamanzi. Ngaphambili, iintsapho ezininzi zazixhomekeke kumthombo omnye womvuzo, ngoxa omnye umzali ehlala ekhaya ukuze anyamekele abantwana. Eli lungiselelo langqineka liyingenelo kwimpilo-ntle nakuphuhliso lwabantwana.

Kwezinye iimeko, xa bobabini abazali bezibophelele kwingqesho emiselweyo, ootitshala baye baba ngabalondolozi babanye abantu. Ngoku sibona iziphumo zokubandakanyeka okuncinci kwabazali kunye nemingeni esijongene nayo isizukulwana esasithembele kakhulu kootishala.

Ixesha endandinokulichitha nabazali bam lalincinane ngenxa yesikolo, nto leyo eyayisiba nzima nangakumbi kum kuba utata wasweleka ndineminyaka elishumi nanye. Kwafuneka ndilishiye ikhaya ukuze ndifumane imfundo ebhetele emva kokusweleka kwakhe. Oku kwandenza ndafuna ukuyiqonda ngakumbi inkqubo yemfundo, ngakumbi njengoko ndandilungiselela ukuba nabantwana bam. 

Ndandingafuni ukuba badlule kumava anzima afanayo. Indlela abaqhuba ngayo abafundi abaphumelele esikolweni emva ko-1994 ibonise ifuthe elibi lenkqubo yezemfundo.

3.2. Ubuncinane inkqubo yesikolo esesikweni iyabafundisa abantu, akunjalo?

Ukuba besinokuvuma ukuba uhambo lwethu lwemfundo lubumba ubuni bethu kwaye lumisela ikamva lethu, njengoko likhuthazwa ngabaxhasi bemfundo yasesikolweni, oko kuya kuthetha ukuba abantu abagqibileyo imfundo yabo, njengesikolo samabanga aphakamileyo, baya kufumana iziphumo ezifanayo okanye ubuncinane ezithelekisekayo, ngenxa yokuba baye bafunda ikharityhulam efanayo. 

Abo bafunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ezihlelelekileyo babeya kuba nelona nqanaba lisezantsi lokuphumelela, kanye njengokuba abo bafunda kwizikolo ezibizayo zikarhulumente okanye zabucala ezikumgangatho ophezulu babeya kuba neziphumo ezithelekisekayo phezulu.

Nangona kunjalo, inyani ikude kwizinto esizibonayo xa sijonga iziphumo zokwenyani, ngakumbi kwicala elilungileyo.

Ngoxa isikolo siyinxalenye yobomi kwabaninzi, impembelelo yaso kwimpumelelo okanye ekusileleni komntu idla ngokubabaxa. Kusenokuba sengqiqweni ukucinga ukuba abantu abafunda kwizikolo ezifanayo babeya kuba neziphumo ezifanayo okanye ubuncinane ezithelekisekayo, inyaniso yahluke lee!

Ukuba imfundo yasesikolweni idlala indima encinci kangaka kwiziphumo zabantu, kutheni ke sityala ixesha elininzi kunye nezibonelelo kuyo? Kutheni sincama amaxesha axabisekileyo nabantwana bethu njengabazali, sisazi ukuba asinakuze silibuyise elo xesha, ukuze nje bakwazi ukuya esikolweni? Siyithathe njani yaye nini le ndlela yokucinga?

Ngo-2023, imeko inokuba ngakumbi malunga nesizukulwana "esizelwe sikhululekile". Inani elibalulekileyo labantu abasuka kwixesha lasemva ko-1994 abaphelelanga nje ekugqibezeleni amabanga aphantsi naphakamileyo ngempumelelo kodwa baye bakhetha ukuqhubela phambili nemfundo ephakamileyo kwinqanaba lemfundo ephakamileyo. Oku kufanele kukhokhelele kumazinga angcono empumelelo kunezizukulwana zangaphambili ezingafundanga kangako, njengoko kwakuthenjisiwe ngabathetheleli besikolo abasesikweni.

Inyaniso yahluke ngokupheleleyo.

Esi sizukulwana, nangona sineminyaka emininzi yokufunda ngokusesikweni, eneneni siqhuba kakubi ngakumbi kunangaphambili. Abaninzi baye baxhomekeke kwinkxaso-mali yerhafu kwaye babambelele kumjikelo wokungaqeshwa. Ziye zaba ngumthwalo ongunaphakade kubahlawuli berhafu nakubazali babo. Ngenxa yoko, abazali bajamelene nokungaqiniseki ngobudala babo, njengoko kufuneka basebenze ixesha elide okanye bathembele kumvuzo wabo womhlala-phantsi ukuze banyamekele abantwana babo nabazukulwana.
4. Imvelaphi yezembali yenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni.

Kubalulekile ukuqonda ukuba izenzo ezinjengenkolo yamaKrestu nemfundo zendele nzulu kwinkcubeko yethu, zibengathi azinakuthandabuzwa futhi zingaphaya kwemibuzo. Nangona kunjalo, xa kuhlolisiswa ngokusondeleyo, kuyacaca ukuba ezi zenzo zinokuba neziphumo ezimbi kwixesha elide.

Kusukelo lwam lolwazi nokuqonda, ndiye ndachitha ixesha lam elininzi lokuzonwabisa ukuze ndingene ezincwadini nakwiingxelo ezibonisa ukukhanya kwezi zifundo. Ndiye ndachukunyiswa ndaza ndakhanyiselwa koko ndikufundileyo.

Ngoxa ndisenokungasoloko ndikuxabisa ukufunda imbali, ndiye ndakuthanda ukuqonda okuxabisekileyo okuzuzwe ngokuhlolisisa ixesha elidluleyo. Ukufumana umxholo wembali yosapho lwam kunye nokuphonononga imbali yoluntu lwam kunye noluntu luphela kungqineke kubaluleke kakhulu ekubumbeni ikamva lam. Kunyaka wamashumi amabini anesithathu, ndiziva ndinethamsanqa ukufumana ithuba lokuphengulula kwimisebenzi etsala umdla yababhali bokuqala abathi baqalisa inkqubo yokubhala kunye nokugcinwa kweerekhodi.

4.1. Yaqala nini yaye phi yonke le nto?

Imbali yenkqubo yesikolo yangoku inkulu kwaye intsonkothile, kodwa ndiza kuchukumisa imiba echaphazelekayo. Ukuqonda izinto ezinempembelelo eziye zamisela inkqubo yemfundo ibe yile nto iyiyo namhlanje kubalulekile. Iye yaba yimodeli yefektri esemgangathweni, ithintela ubuchule kunye nokuvelisa abantu abathobelayo. Le modeli ayiguquguquki kuphela eNtshona kodwa naseMzantsi Afrika.

Imfundo nenkolo bezisoloko zinxibelelene ngokusondeleyo. Izikolo zokuqala ezisesikweni zinokulandelwa ukuya kumawaka amathathu BC kunye namaSumeri namaJiphutha, befundisa abafundi ukufunda nokubhala. Ngewaka ngaphambi kweXesha Eliqhelekileyo, izikolo zonqulo eSiriya zazifundisa imibhalo engcwele yesiHebhere, kodwa babembalwa ababenelungelo lokuzifumana. UConfucius wavula izikolo zokuqala zomntu wonke, kungekhona nje abantu abaphezulu.

Ngotshintsho olusuka kumzingeli-umqokeleli ukuya kuluntu lwezolimo, imfuno yemfundo yakhula. Abantwana kwakufuneka bafunde izakhono ezifunekayo kumsebenzi wezandla kwezolimo. Kwagxininiswa intobelo nentlonelo, yaye umoya wemvukelo wawunokuba nemiphumo ebuhlungu. Ukukhula kwexesha lemizi-mveliso kuye kwanyusa ngakumbi imfuneko yabasebenzi abathobelayo nabathobelayo.

4.2. Iziqalo zokwenyani kumiliselo olukrokrisayo.

Imfundo esesikweni yasekwa ngeenjongo ezintle, ngenjongo yokuphucula uluntu. Nangona kunjalo, iye yasetyenziswa kakubi ekuhambeni kwexesha. Inkqubo yemfundo yasesikolweni iye yagqwethwa ngokuthe ngcembe ngabantu abafuna inzuzo yobuqu, becinezela abarhafi besebenzisa abantwana njengeemali zabo. 

UMartin Luther, umfundisi waseJamani, waba nendima ebalulekileyo ekuphunyezweni kwemfundo yesinyanzelo phesheya. Injongo yakhe yayikukwenza iBhayibhile ifumaneke ngakumbi kumakholwa ngokukhuthaza imfundo kawonke-wonke.

IJamani yawisa imithetho ngenkulungwane yeshumi elinesixhenxe, yenza imfundo ibe sisinyanzelo kwaye iqhutywe yicawe yamaLuthere. Ngenkulungwane yeshumi elinesibhozo, iJamani yayinenkqubo yemfundo exhaswa ngerhafu, eyaphembelela amanye amazwe, kuquka iUnited States.

Oosomashishini eMelika bafuna ukudala abasebenzi abaya kuthi ngokuthobela bavumelane kwaye bangababuze abo baphetheyo. Amaziko abucala afana neBhodi yeMfundo Jikelele, exhaswa ngemali ngoosomashishini abazizityebi abafana no-John D. Rockefeller no-Andrew Carnegie, babumba inkqubo yemfundo ngokwemibono yabo.

Ukuthatha inxaxheba kukarhulumente kwimfundo emiselweyo kuye kwanda ngokusekwa kwezikolo zikarhulumente ezixhaswa ngerhafu. Ngeminyaka elishumi elinesithoba, ukuya esikolweni kwaba sinyanzelo kumazwe aseMelika. Umbono wokubumba abantu ukuze bafanelekele iimfuno zoluntu nokungakhathaleli usukelo lwengqondo waba ngundaba-mlonyeni.

Kuyadanisa ukubona indlela amalinge aneenjongo ezintle anokujijwa ngayo aze agqwethwe ngabantu abaqhutywa kukuzingca. Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni, ecetyelwe ukunika amandla nokukhanyisa, ngokufuthi iye yaba lixhoba lamandla anjalo.

4.3. Imfundo esesikweni eMzantsi Afrika.

NgokukaGqirha Hendrik Verwoerd, umphathiswa wemicimbi yemveli kwiminyaka yeshumi elinesithoba umgaqo-nkqubo wezemfundo wesebe lemveli ugxininise ukubaluleka kokumiliselwa kwemfundo kwiindawo zomthonyama kunye noluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika. Kwakubalulekile ukukhokela abantu baBantu ukuba bakhonze uluntu lwabo kwaye bazimele ngaphakathi.

Uphuhliso lwembali lwenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni yelizwe lubonakalisa imingeni ejongene neentlanga ezahlukeneyo. Lo mxholo wembali unika ukukhanya kubuntsokotha nemizabalazo yenkqubo yemfundo yaseMzantsi Afrika.

Ukususela xa izikolo zokuqala ezisesikweni zaziswayo yi-Dutch Cape Colony ukuya ekubandakanyekeni kwecawe yobuKristu kunye nokutshintshwa ngokuthe ngcembe kolawulo lusuka kumaziko enkolo lusiwe kurhulumente lubonise utshintsho olutshintshayo lwemfundo.

Iimpembelelo zembali ngaphandle kwamathandabuzo ziye zayila zaqinisa imfundo esesikweni njengomgangatho wentlalo, kodwa inkqubela esele iphunyeziwe iye yaphazanyiswa ngamandla ezoqoqosho, ezentlalo, kunye nezopolitiko ukusukela kwishumi elinesithoba lamashumi alithoba anesine. Xa kujongwa imeko yelizwe ngoku, inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo ilishiye ilizwe likwimeko embi kakhulu.


5. Eyona njongo yenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni, njengoko sibona ngeziphumo.

Ukusukela kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesine, uMzantsi Afrika ubone isizukulwana esifunde kakhulu sivela, kodwa iziphumo zoku kwanda kwemfundo azikhange ikhokelele kuphuculo olulindelekileyo kweli lizwe. Phezu kwawo nje amanani aphakamileyo obhaliso nokugxininiswa kwemfundo esesikweni, indlela eliqhuba ngayo ilizwe kwiinkalo ezibalulekileyo ezifana nentswela-ngqesho, ulwaphulo-mthetho nokukhula koqoqosho ayikafikeleli izithembiso ezenziwa kubahlawuli berhafu nakubazali.

Inkqubo yemfundo iye yasilela ekuxhobiseni abaphumeleleyo ngezakhono ezisebenzayo, nto leyo ekhokelela ekubeni bangayikhathaleli imisebenzi yezandla nokungabi namdla wokwenza umsebenzi wezandla. Uqhawulo lonxibelelwano phakathi kwemfundo esesikweni kunye nobuchule behlabathi lokwenyani lukwabonwa kukunqongophala komsebenzi kumaqumrhu karhulumente anabasebenzi abaphumelele izidanga, uninzi lwabo lubonise ukutyekela kuburhwaphilizo endaweni yonikezelo lweenkonzo olunempumelelo.

Imeko yezopolitiko yonakaliswe ngamahlazo kunye nokungasebenzi kakuhle, okubangela ukuba kube kuthandatyuzwa ukusebenza ngempumelelo kwenkqubo yemfundo yeli lizwe ekuveliseni abemi abathembekileyo, abanobuchule. Ngenxa yoko, uMzantsi Afrika uzifumana ukwimeko enzima, neziphumo zemigaqo-nkqubo yezobusoshiyali kunye nentshukumo eqinisekisiweyo ziyenza mandundu ngakumbi imeko.

Ngenxa yezi nyaniso zokwenene, kubalulekile ukuvavanya iziphumo eziyinyani zenkqubo yemfundo esesikweni kwaye ubuze ukuba yintoni kanye kanye esele ifikelele kuyo.

5.1. Ukuphanga noRhwaphilizo.

Uphononongo loHlahlo-lwabiwo-mali lwamashumi amabini ananye olwenziwa nguNondyebo weSizwe luveza ukuba ulwabiwo lwelizwe lokufunda nenkcubeko kuqikelelwa ukuba luya kukhula kakhulu kule minyaka imbalwa izayo. ISebe leMfundo esiSiseko (DBE) lifumana esona sabelo sikhulu kuwo onke amasebe, isixa-mali esimangalisayo esizibhiliyoni zeeRandi ezingama-255.1. Nangona kunjalo, kuyabonakala ukuba ezi mali zabarhafi zisetyenziselwe inzuzo yomntu liqela elilawulayo.

Ukudalwa kwezikhundla ezongezelelweyo zobuphathiswa kumashumi amabini aneshumi kwisebe lezemfundo kukhokelele ekonyukeni kweendleko kubahlawuli berhafu, kuxhamle amalungu eqela athembekileyo. Isizathu sikarhulumente solu lwahlulo yayikukuphucula unikezelo lweenkonzo nokusebenza kakuhle. Noko ke, imiphumo iye yanelisa.

Isebe lemfundo esisiseko lenze inkcitho engaqhelekanga efikelela kwinqaku leebhiliyoni ezine zeerandi, kwaye uMphathiswa weMfundo ePhakamileyo, obambe isikhundla sakhe ukusukela kumashumi amabini aneshumi, akakhange abonakalise mpucuko ibonakalayo kwisikhundla sakhe. Urhwaphilizo kunye nokuxhasana kudlulela ngaphaya kokuqeshwa kwangaphakathi, ngeethenda ezinikezelwa ngokusekelwe kunxibelelwano lwezopolitiko endaweni yexabiso okanye umgangatho.

Lo mkhuba worhwaphilizo ugqugqisile kwinkqubo yezemfundo, ngeengxelo zokusetyenziswa gwenxa kwezibonelelo, ulawulo olugwenxa, nokusetyenziswa kakubi kwegunya ezikolweni.

Kwanamaziko anembali ebekekileyo, afana neUNISA neFort Hare, angcoliswe zizityholo zorhwaphilizo. Imiphumo yolu rhwaphilizo mibi, yaye ubomi babantu buyachaphazeleka yaye bude buphulukane. Liyothusa inani lamantombazana azalwayo aphakathi kweminyaka elishumi ukuya kwelishumi elinesithoba, amanye awo akhulelwa ngootishala neenqununu eziwasebenzisa kakubi amagunya awo.

Kucacile ukuba uhlahlo lwabiwo-mali lwezemfundo lusetyenziswe ngendlela engeyiyo ukuze kuzuze yena, kujongelwa phantsi inkqubela yelizwe. Oku kuxhaphazwa ngabom kweemali zabarhafi ukuze kuxhamle umbutho olawulayo kukungcatsha uMgaqo-siseko kunye nabantu besizwe. Eyona njongo yale nkqubo yesikolo yayingelokunceda ilizwe lilonke, kodwa kukusebenzela umbutho olawulayo.

Inkqubo yemfundo esesikweni ibe sisixhobo esisebenza kakhulu sokuba abezopolitiko baphange ilizwe ukuze bazisole.

5.2. Ukufundisa abantu ubuxoki nokubahlutha izakhono abanokuthi bazisebenzise ukuze bakwazi ukuzimela, ukuze baqhubeke bevotela umbutho olawulayo.

Ukuqinisekisa isiseko sovoto esizinzileyo kubalulekile kumaqela ezopolitiko, ingakumbi lawo angasekhohlo axhomekeke kwizithembiso simahla kunye noncedo lukarhulumente lokukhusela iivoti. Nangona kunjalo, esi sicwangciso asizinzile kwixesha elide, njengoko abantu beqaphela ukungafezeki kwezi zithembiso kwaye bafumana ulwazi malunga nemigaqo-nkqubo ye-libertarian ekhuthaza uxanduva lomntu kunye nenkululeko. Ukugcina igunya, iqela elilawulayo kufuneka lifumane amacebo asebenzayo okuqinisekisa ukuqhubeka kwawo elawula.

Isicwangciso esisebenzayo silele kwinkqubo yesikolo. Ngokuchaseneyo nenkolelo exhaphakileyo, umgangatho wemfundo ophantsi awubangelwa nje kukungaphumeleli, kodwa umzamo owenziwe ngabom weqela elilawulayo lokujongela phantsi inkqubo. Ngokuthintela abaphumeleleyo ekufumaneni ulwazi olwaneleyo nezakhono, iqela elilawulayo linokugcina ubuqhetseba balo kwaye lilawule izihlwele ngobuxoki. Olu qeqesho luqala besebancinci, apho abafundi bafundiswa ukugxeka abanye ngokusilela kukarhulumente kwaye bamkele imigaqo-nkqubo ekhuthaza ukulingana ngerhafu ephezulu kunye neyantlukwano yobuhlanga.

Urhulumente ukwaqinisekisa ukuba abantu baxhomekeke kuncedo loluntu, edala ukuthembela kumbutho olawulayo ukuze baphile. Ezi nkxaso-mali, nangona ziqale zaziswa njengezexeshana, azifane zivumele abo bazifumanayo ukuba bahlukane nokuxhomekeka kwabo. Ngokugcina abantu bethembele kurhulumente, umbutho olawulayo uzuza abalandeli bakhe ubomi bonke abaya kuqhubeka ubavotela, beqinisekisa ukuba bahlala belawula.

Inkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo idlala indima ebalulekileyo kwesi sicwangciso. Oorhulumente abacinezelayo babeka phambili kwaye benze imfundo ibe sisinyanzelo ukuze bafundise abemi kwaye bakhusele ukunyaniseka kwabo. Ingcamango ye-hard-left eye yakhawulezisa ukutshabalala kweNtshona kwaye isongela ikamva loluntu iye yaqiniswa ngemfundo esemthethweni, ngokuphindaphinda rhoqo amabali obuxoki kunye neengcamango ezingenasiphelo. Imalunga nelokuba abona bantu baneembono ezibaxiweyo badla ngokuba ngabathweswe izidanga kumaziko abalulekileyo, ekufuneka bazi ngcono kodwa baxhaphaze abanye. Kwanemibutho ebangela iyantlukwano neyonakalisayo efana neBlack Lives Matter, eyamkelwa ngabezobupolitika, iye yakhokelwa ngabantu abaxhamle kwimfundo enomsila.

Akumangalisi ukuba uninzi lweenjingalwazi zekholeji zichonga njengenkululeko, njengoko zidlala indima ephambili ekuguquleni abafundi abaphumeleleyo kunye nokugqwetha iinyaniso zendalo. Ubudlelwane phakathi kwabezobupolitika, amagosa karhulumente, neenkcuba-buchopho buyayibethelela ngakumbi le mfundiso. Abezopolitiko baxhomekeke kwiinkcuba-buchopho ukunika intembeko kwimigaqo-nkqubo yasekhohlo, ngelixa iinkcuba-buchopho ziwongwa ngenkxaso-mali yomrhafi kunye namanye amathuba okuzityebisa.

Lilonke, inkqubo yemfundo sisixhobo esinamandla sokudala ukuxhomekeka kunye nokuxhoma ingqondo kwabemi.

5.3. Ukwenza buthathaka impembelelo yabazali.
"Kunzima ukucinga indlela yobudenge okanye eyingozi ngakumbi yokwenza izigqibo kunokubeka ezo zigqibo ezandleni zabantu abangabhatali xabiso xa bephazamile"
Thomas Sowell

Abazali bam babesoloko bekholelwa ekubalulekeni kwemfundo. Ndandikuthanda ukufunda ndisengumntwana yaye ndabona indlela imfundo eyamnceda ngayo utata ukuze anyamekele intsapho yakowethu.

Noko ke, ndaqalisa ukuzibuza isizathu sokuba abanye abantwana bangavumi ukuya esikolweni. Kwakukho abazali ababechasa ngamandla kwaye bavakalisa inkxalabo yabo malunga nesikolo, besithi sivalela abantwana babo amava abalulekileyo okufunda kwihlabathi lokwenyani. Kulapho ndabona khona ukuba urhulumente unyanzelisa ngokusemthethweni abantwana ukuba baye esikolweni, nto leyo eyandibhidayo. 

Ukuba ukuya esikolweni kuyingenelo kangaka, kutheni kufuneka kwenziwe isinyanzelo?

Kutheni umtu eza kunyanzelwe ukuba enze okulungileyo kuye? Akukho mithetho yakhe yafuneka ukuze inyanzele abantu ukuba batye ukutya okanye baphefumle; Zonke izinto eziphilayo ziyakwazi ngethuku lemvelo oku kwaye ziyakwenza. Kunokuba abantu bachithe kuba bengatyi, ukutyeba kuyingxaki kumazwe ahambele phambili kwezoqoqosho. Imithetho imiselwe ukuba ithintele ukutya ukutya okuthile kuba zonke izinto eziphilayo ziyazi ukuba isondlo siyimfuneko.

Ugxininiso lukarhulumente kwimfundo enyanzelekileyo luye lwaphumela ekuncipheni kolawulo lwabazali kubantwana babo, nto leyo eyayiyinjongo kwasekuqaleni.

Akukhange kubekho sixhobo sikhulu sokuququzelela oku kuthotywa kwegunya labazali kunenkqubo yezikolo ezisesikweni. Imeko iyothusa kakhulu, nabaxhasi benkqubo yezemfundo bekhuthaza ukuba abantwana baqale isikolo bebancinci. Abazali badla ngokuxelelwa ukuba imfundo yabantwana iluncedo kuba ibavumela ukuba basebenze ngoxa umntwana wabo efunda.

Uphononongo kunye noqwalaselo olubonakalayo lubonise ukuba izinto eziluncedo kwimfundo yabantwana abasaqalayo azinampembelelo nje kuphela, kodwa zineziphumo ezibi ngokwenene kumntwana nakubazali.

5.4. Ukubaluleka koluntu kumxholo wosapho.

Namhlanje, igama elithi "uluntu" lihlala litolikwa gwenxa kwaye lisetyenziselwa ukunyanzela abantu ukuba bathwale imithwalo enxulumene nemfundo yoluntu. Ke ngoko, kuyabaluleka ukuseka inkcazo ecacileyo yeyona nto ibandakanya uluntu. Mandibonise oku ngokwabelana ngemizekelo esuka kwilali yam nakusapho lwam.

Ndazalelwa eeNtshatshongo, ilali esemaphandleni ekumgama oziikhilomitha ezilishumi ukusuka kunxweme lweMpuma Koloni. Kule lali, amakhaya ezalamane zam ezisondeleyo ayemi kufutshane, amaqhina ezalamane ayencipha njengoko umgama usanda. Lo mzekelo ubonakala kwilali kabawo, iNqabane, apho amalungu osapho ahlala kufutshane.

Ekukhuleni kwam, ngalo lonke ixesha ndityelela ezi lali, ndandiziva ndinolwalamano olomeleleyo nabantu ngenxa yobudlelane bethu bentsapho. Olu nxibelelwano lwandenza ndaziva ndingumntu ongomnye. Olu luvo lunamandla loluntu lwabangelwa kukuthontelana okuphantsi kwabantu bangaphandle ngokwembali nakwindlela eyayixhaphakile yokutshatana ezilalini. Ngenxa yoko, wonke umzali ekuhlaleni waziva enomdla kwintlalo-ntle yabo bonke abantwana, ebotshelelwe ngamaqhina obuzalwana.

Olu luntu lumanyeneyo lusebenze kunye kwaye lutyale imali kwinjongo enye. Ukuqulunqwa kolu luntu lwaluhlala luzinzile, kunye bambalwa nabantu abangaphandle abazibandakanyayo. Olu luvo lozinzo lwafaka ukuzithemba “kubatyali-zimali” ukuba izizukulwana zabo zexesha elizayo nazo ziya kuvuna ingenelo.

Izikolo zokuqala endazifundayo, zazakhiwe ngokuyintloko ngeenzame ezihlangeneyo zoluntu. Abazali badibanisa izixhobo zabo kwaye bakha ukwakha oko urhulumente angakwaziyo.

Nangona imali yayinqongophele, uluntu lwaluneqhayiya ngokusebenza kunye nokuphumeza oko lunokukwenza. Andizikhumbuli izihlandlo apho abantu bonakalisa ngabom ipropathi yesikolo kuba nabo beza kwenzakalisa into abayincedileyo yokwakha, yaye behlobene nomntu oza kuchatshazelwa ngulo monakalo.

Olu luntu lwalumanyane kwaye luzinikele kwiinjongo ekwabelwana ngazo, luqhutywa kukuqhelana kwabo ixesha elide kwizizukulwana ngezizukulwana kunye nentshukumo enyiniweyo yabantu abangena nokuphuma ezilalini.

Inkcazo efanayo yoluntu ayinakusetyenziswa kumaxesha angoku, ngakumbi kwinqanaba lesizwe, singasathethi ke ngamazwe ngamazwe.

Ngenxa yolu tshintsho, kuba yinto engekho ngqiqweni ukulindela ukuba abantu ngabanye bancede abantu abangabaziyo nabangenakuze badibane nabo. Aba bantu basemzini basenokuba ngabahlobo okanye ziintshaba, nto leyo eyenza kube nzima ngabo ukuba bamkelwe kwiilali ezintsha.


Icandelo lesibini: Apho ndiqale khona
6. Imfundo yasekhaya kunye noMthetho, uMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika. 

UMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika ngowona mthetho uphakamileyo welizwe, nawuphi na umthetho ongahambelaniyo nawo awusebenzi. Iqinisekisa ilungelo lemfundo esisiseko kumntu wonke. UMgaqo-siseko awuchazi ukuba yintoni efanelekela ukuba yimfundo esisiseko, uyiyekela kubazali nabagcini babantwana abasemthethweni ukuba benze isigqibo.

Urhulumente kufuneka aphumeze eli lungelo esebenzisa amanyathelo afanelekileyo, kwaye ukuba la manyathelo afunyaniswa engafanelekanga, uMgaqo-siseko uyoyisa. UMgaqo-siseko ukwabamkela abazali nosapho njengabona banonopheli babantwana kwaye uvumela kuphela ukhathalelo olulolunye ukuba kukho izizathu ezivakalayo zokukholelwa ukuba oko kuyimfuneko.

Njengomzali, ndinelungelo lokuyichasa imfundo yasesikolweni ukuba iphazamisana noxanduva lwam lokunyamekela umntwana wam. Kunzima ukuthethelela ukuthabatha abantwana kubazali babo baze bafundiswe baze banyanyekelwe ngabantu abangabaziyo, ngaphandle kokuba abazali nosapho baye babhengezwa njengengozi emntwaneni.

6.1. Ngaba ndophula umthetho ngokungamhambisi umntwana wam esikolweni?

Akunjalo. Ilungelo lesikolo sasekhaya likhuselwe nguMgaqo-siseko kwaye ityala likaSchneider likucacisile ukuba ukungathotyelwa kwemithetho ethile akuyi kuthathwa njengokwaphulwa komthetho.

Oku kuphakamisa imibuzo malunga negunya leSebe leMfundo esiSiseko lokulawula imfundo yasemakhaya. UMthetho weZikolo waseMzantsi Afrika, umzekelo, ugunyazisa ukuhamba isikolo ngokusesikweni ukususela kwiminyaka esixhenxe ukuya kwelishumi elinesihlanu kwaye uwise izohlwayo okanye ukuvalelwa entolongweni ngenxa yokungathobeli. Icandelo lamashumi amahlanu ananye likwafuna ukuba abazali babhalise abantwana abafunda emakhaya.

Umbutho olawulayo namahlakani alo azama ukuwisa uMthetho-siHlomelo osaYilwayo weMithetho yeMfundo esiSiseko, ojolise ekutyhaleleni abantwana kwinkqubo yemfundo esesikweni. Lo mthetho uyilwayo ujongene nenkcaso evela kumaqela ngamaqela, aquka i-AfriForum kunye ne-Institute of Race Relations (IRR), abathi ibeka amandla kwindawo eyodwa ezandleni zikaRhulumente kwaye ijongela phantsi ukubandakanyeka koluntu ezikolweni. Abazali abaninzi, kunye nemibutho efana nePestalozzi Trust, bamile ngokuchasene neli tyala. Amaqela aphikisayo afana neFreedom Front Plus (FF+), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), kunye neDemocratic Alliance (DA) nawo avakalise inkcaso emandla.

Urhulumente akakhange ayeke kwiinzame zakhe zokutyhafisa ukufundiswa kwamakhaya, kodwa abazali kunye nemibutho yabameli bayalwa. Amagosa ezemfundo eKZN ade enze nzima ukuba abazali babhalisele ukufunda emakhaya, nto leyo ebangele ukuba iPestalozzi Trust ithathele amanyathelo asemthethweni.

6.2. Imfundo yasekhaya kunye noMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika.

Nangona iCandelo lamashumi amabini anesithoba lisenokubonakala lilelona candelo lifanelekileyo ekuphononongeni imfundo yasekhaya eMzantsi Afrika, eneneni liCandelo lamashumi amabini anesibhozo loMgaqo-siseko elibaluleke kakhulu. Eli candelo limisela ithoni kwaye lisebenza njengomgaqo osisikhokelo, libeka phambili intlalo-ntle kunye neemfuno ezingcono zomntwana kuyo yonke imiba enxulumene nabo.

NgoNovemba ishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi asibhozo anesithoba, iNgqungquthela yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ngamaLungelo oMntwana (i-UNCRC) yamkelwa yaza yaqalisa ukusebenza kunyaka olandelayo. UMzantsi Afrika utyikitye iSivumelwano kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesithathu waza wasiqinisekisa kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi alithoba anesithandathu. Inqaku lesithathu leNgqungquthela lithetha ngokuthe ngqo ngeyona nto ilunge kakhulu emntwaneni, lichaza ukuba kufuneka libe yingqwalasela ephambili kuzo zonke izenzo eziphathelele abantwana.

Le Ngqungquthela ikwaqaphela ukubaluleka kosapho njengeqela elisisiseko lentlalontle kunye nokusingqongileyo kwendalo ukuze abantwana bakhule kwaye baphumelele. Igxininisa imfuneko yokuba intsapho ifumane inkxaso efunekayo ukuze iphumeze iimbopheleleko zayo ekuhlaleni.

Ngenxa yemiba elijongene nayo iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko (DBE), akucaci ukuba nabani na unokuphikisa ngelithi ukufunda okusesikweni yeyona ndlela ifanelekileyo yomntwana, ngakumbi xa kukho ezinye iindlela ezizezinye ezifumanekayo. Izalathi ezahlukeneyo zibonisa ukuba isebe liyasilela nakwisigunyaziso salo esisisiseko sokufundisa ukufunda nokubhala nokubala okusisiseko.

Ngako oko, urhulumente, nge-DBE, wohlulekile ukwenza okona kulungileyo komntwana njengoko ifunwa yi-UNCRC.

Okungundoqo kuko konke oku kukuqondwa ukuba wonke umntwana unamalungelo asisiseko, kuquka ilungelo lokuphila, ukuphila, nokukhula; ukukhuselwa kubundlobongela, ukuxhatshazwa, okanye ukungahoywa; imfundo ebenza bafikelele kwisakhono sabo esipheleleyo; ukukwazi ukuba nobudlelwane nabazali bobabini, nokuba bahlukene; ilungelo lokuvakalisa izimvo zabo nokuviwa; ukukhuselwa kwemfihlo yabo; kunye nesiqinisekiso sokuba ubomi babo abuphazanyiswa ngokugqithisileyo.

6.3. Yintoni imfundo esisiseko?

Oosopolitiki noonobuhle borhulumente balahlekise abazali ukuba bacinge ukuba imfundo yasesikolweni yeyona ndlela yokufundisa abantwana babo, kwaye iSebe leMfundo esiSiseko libandakanyeke koku. Kuyaxhalabisa ukubonakaliswa kwenkcaso njengento engekho mthethweni kunye neenzame zokungakhuthazi ezinye iindlela zemfundo, ngakumbi xa kujongwa imeko embi yenkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo.
Inkcazo yesikolo njengesikolo esimiselweyo emthethweni iyaphikisana noMgaqo-siseko, othatha indlela esekelwe ukwanela ekuchazeni imfundo esisiseko. Abazali bangundoqo ekuchazeni imfundo esisiseko, yaye amaziko ahlukahlukeneyo nabantu ngabanye, kuquka abaqulunqi bomthetho, abaqulunqi bomgaqo-nkqubo, ootitshala, abafundi nemibutho yasekuhlaleni, bafak’ isandla ekuxonxeni ukuqonda nokusetyenziswa kwelungelo lemfundo esisiseko. Ukulichaza eli lungelo ekugqibeleni ngumzamo wedemokhrasi nentsebenziswano.

6.4. Amanye amazwe kunye nembono yehlabathi.

Kumazwe apho imfundo isinyanzeliso, ibethelelwa kowona mthetho uphakamileyo wawo. Imfundo yasekhaya isemthethweni kwamanye amazwe amaninzi, njengoko igutyungelwe kakhulu ngabafundi baseKhaya baseMzantsi Afrika.

UMgaqo-siseko waseMzantsi Afrika uyayiqonda indima ebalulekileyo yabazali kwimfundo yomntwana wabo. Ngoko ke, iqinisekisa ukuba isikolo esisisinyanzelo asikuphela kwendlela yokubonelela ngemfundo esisiseko. Amanye amacandelo oMgaqo-siseko nawo akhusela kwaye akhuthaze indima ebalulekileyo yabazali neentsapho.
7. Indawo yokusukela.

Ndacinga ngamava am kwizikolo zikarhulumente xa ndithatha isigqibo sokuba imfundo yasekhaya ilungile na ebantwaneni bam. Ndandidla ngokucinga ukuba impumelelo yam ebomini yayibangelwa yimfundo yam yasesikolweni kuphela; nangona kunjalo, ukuba bekunjalo, ngoko wonke umntu oye wangena kwisikolo esifanayo ufanele afikelele kwinqanaba elifanayo lempumelelo ubuncinane.

Noko ke, xa ndathelekisa imiphumo yabantu abanemvelaphi efanayo yemfundo, ndaqonda ukuba impumelelo efanayo yayingeyonto iqhelekileyo kodwa yayingaqhelekanga. Enyanisweni, abantu abaninzi abaye bafumana impumelelo engathethekiyo ngokwezinto eziphathekayo babengenamfundo yasesikolweni kwiinkalo zabo.

Olu qwalaselo lwayicel’ umngeni inkolelo yokuba inkqubo yesikolo inempembelelo enkulu kumntu ngamnye. Abantu abaninzi abaphumeleleyo eMzantsi Afrika banemfundo encinane okanye abanayo kwaphela. Kwandicacela ukuba oyena ndoqo wempumelelo usekukwazini ukuqhubeka nomnombo wakhe nokubonelela isizukulwana esilandelayo.

Ifuthe lemfundo yasesikolweni, esele likho ixeshana elifutshane kuphela, libaxekile ngokugqithisileyo. Ndicinga ngokukhula kwam, apho abazali bam babeyibeke phambili imfundo kwaye bebonelela ngezixhobo zokufunda ekhaya, ndakubona ukubaluleka kwezi mpawu ndaza ndafuna ukuzandisa ngemfundo yasekhaya.
 
7.1. Imvelaphi yesikolo yabazali ngokuchasene nenkqubela phambili yesikolo.

Xa sikhethela abantwana bethu eyona ndlela ifanelekileyo yemfundo, bekubalulekile ukuba sithathele ingqalelo imvelaphi yemfundo kunye nezimbo zobuzali esathi zanikwa thina njengabazali, nendlela ezihambelana ngayo nenkqubela esiyenzileyo emva kokuphuma kwesikolo. Ukuhambelana kwezini, okuyimfuneko ekukhawulweni komntwana, kuhlala kubalulekile ngokulinganayo emva kokuba umntwana ezelwe. Ivumela abazali ukuba bathelekise kwaye bathelekise amava abo obuntwana kwaye baqonde ukuba babubumba njani ubudala babo.

Elona xesha lide, ngokuchaseneyo neemfundiso zesikolo ezisesikweni ngokufuthi zazigxininisa impembelelo yokukhulisa kwindalo, zingayikhathaleli impembelelo yemfuza. Kwakukholelwa ukuba imeko-bume yayigqiba ukuba ubani ungubani, nto leyo eyayifana neembono zikaJohn Broadus Watson.

Ukanti, eneneni, indima yemfuza ekubumbeni iimpawu zobuntu ayinakubethwa ngoyaba. Ngokucacileyo, ukubaluleka kwendalo ngaphezu kokukhuliswa kuye kwaphawulwa ziingcali ezahlukeneyo, ezifana noGqr Mark Leary kunye noSteven Pinker. Oku kubaluleke ngakumbi kuSazi, onokubona imiphumo yendalo kunye nokukhuliswa ngenxa yeemvelaphi ezifanayo zabazali bakhe.

Ngaphezu koko, iinzame zoluntu zokukhuthaza inkqubela phambili yabasetyhini zibe nkulu, zijolise ekupheliseni imiqobo ebithintela inkqubela yabo. Ngako oko, akufuneki kuphinde kubekho umkhethe okhetha ukuba amadoda aphumelele ngakumbi, okwenza kube lula ukuthelekisa iziphumo phakathi kwesini.

Indlela esikhule ngayo yayahlukile kangangokuba ngoku sinokuyivavanya impembelelo yayo ngokweziphumo zethu. Ukhulele edolophini eBhayi waya kwisikolo samabanga aphakamileyo esasigxininisa izithethe zobuKristu watshintsha nezikolo kanye. Ndikhulele emaphandleni aseTranskei, ndifunda kwizikolo zikarhulumente ngaphandle kweefizi, ndatshintsha izikolo izihlandlo ezihlanu, ndaza ndachitha iminyaka emine yokugqibela eMpumalanga, apho isikolo sasinelona zinga lisezantsi lokuphumelela imatriki kwisithili saso kumashumi amabini anesibini. I-alma mater kamama wonyana wam iphumelele ikhulu lepesenti. Koko, amashumi alithoba anesine amanqaku ebekufanele ukuba aqhube izifundo zesidanga ekholejini.

Ngenxa yokuba sikhulele kwiindawo ezahlukeneyo ngokupheleleyo, umntu unokulindela umahluko omkhulu phakathi kwethu njengabantu abadala. Kwaye eneneni, kukho umahluko omkhulu, nangona kungenjalo ngendlela umntu anokuyilindela ngayo. Ingcinga yokuba ukuya kwizikolo ezinezibonelelo ezingcono kuya kuqinisekisa iziphumo ezingcono icelwa umngeni zezona ziphumo. Oku kuqonda akuceli umngeni nje kuphela ukongama kwemveli yemfundo yeprayimari yemveli kodwa ikwagxininisa ukungasebenzi kokwenza utyalo-mali olongezelelekileyo kuyo ngaphaya kwexesha elithile.

Ukuqukumbela, ukuphononongwa kwemvelaphi yabazali, imfundo esemthethweni, kunye nempumelelo yobuqu isebenza njengesityhilelo, umngeni kwiinkolelo eziqhelekileyo kwaye igxininisa imida yokuchaza impumelelo ngeendlela eziphathekayo.

7.2. Ubuntu bomntwana kunye nabazali.

Ngelixa abantu abaninzi befumana ukonwabela ukuthatha inxaxheba kwimidlalo nakwimisetyenzana yokuzonwabisa esikolweni, mna, ngokobuqu, andizange ndibe nolwazelelelo olufanayo. Ndandingenamdla kwimidlalo yaye utyekelo lwam lokopha iimpumlo kwanangomsebenzi omncinane womzimba akuzange kuncede.

Ngaphandle kwemeko yesikolo, ndandingenamdla kangako wokuchitha ixesha nabanye abantwana, ngenxa yenkqubo engqongqo kamama. Ngoxa oontanga bam babenenkululeko yokudlala de kube sebusuku baze bazulazule ngaphandle kokuzibamba, ubomi bam basekhaya babahluke ngokupheleleyo. Silandele inkqubo engqongqo:
Vuka kwangentseni uye ngqo esikolweni.
Buyela ngqo ekhaya emva kweeklasi ngaphandle kokujikela.
Gqibezela yonke imisebenzi yasekhaya kwaye uqinisekise ukuba iyunifomu yangomso ilungisiwe, kuquka nezihlangu ezikhazimlisiweyo.
Dlala ngaphandle eyadini nabanye abantwana.
Buyela phambi kwentsimbi yesi-6 pm ukuqinisekisa ukuba isango alitshixwa.
Gqibezela umsebenzi wasekhaya ngaphambi kokulala.

Besingenamfuyo ekhaya. Oku kwakuthetha ukuba amathuba okonwaba ngoxa kusalusa iinkomo emadlelweni aphantse ukuba angabikho. Ebudeni beminyaka yam yeshumi elivisayo sasivuna amanzi emvula, sinciphisa imfuneko yokuya emlanjeni. Nangona kunjalo, oku kwakuthetha amathuba ambalwa okunxibelelana nabanye abantwana. Nasesikolweni samabanga aphakamileyo, ndaqhelana nendlela yabazali bam, ndikhetha ukuhlala kufutshane nekhaya kunokuba ndiphume phandle, nangona ndandifumana amathuba amatsha.

Njengomntu omdala, zimbalwa izinto ezindicaphukisayo njengabantu ababefanisa ukuba nobomi obanelisayo nokuphuma rhoqo. Ukuza kuthi ga namhlanje, ayikho enye indawo endingathanda ukuba kuyo ngaphandle kokuba sekhaya, nto leyo eye, ekuhambeni kwexesha, yaguquka yaba kungekuphela nje indawo yokuthuthuzela kodwa nendawo yam yokusebenza. Ngaphandle kwemiceli mngeni eziswe kukuvalwa okunyanzeliswa ngurhulumente ngokungekho sikweni kunye nemilinganiselo engenelelayo ngexesha lobhubhani we-Covid, ikwaveze izibonelelo ebezingalindelekanga. Enye yezi kukwanda kokusebenza kude nokufunda kude.

Abanye abaninzi baye balixabisa ikhaya njengendawo esisiseko yokusebenza nemfundo. Oku kuqinisekisa isigqibo sam sokulandela ikhondo elahlukileyo xa kuziwa kwimfundo yabantwana bam.

7.3. Imekobume yentsapho.

Ngaphambi kokuba izikolo zemveli zande, iintsapho zazidlala indima yemfundo. Iintsapho ezininzi zazihlala kunye kwindawo enye, enoomakhulu nootatomkhulu, abazali, oodadobawo, oomalume nezinye izalamane. Oku kwadala imekobume yenkxaso apho abantwana babenyanyekelwa ngoxa abantu abadala besebenza, yaye babefunda ubuchule obusebenzisekayo kumalungu entsapho.

Kwikhaya losapho, wonke umntu utyale imali kwimpumelelo yomntwana, ngokungafaniyo kwizikolo zikarhulumente okanye kwizikolo zabucala apho kugxininiswa kwinzuzo yemali. Ngelixa abanye benokuthi umvuzo ubalulekile kubafundisi-ntsapho, iingenelo zokufunda ekhaya ziquka ukomelezwa kwemilinganiselo yosapho.

Imfundo yasekhaya inokuba lucelomngeni kubazali abangenamaqabane okanye izibini ezizibophelelayo ngomsebenzi, njengoko kusenokufuna ukuqesha umntu oza kunyamekela umntwana aze afundise ekhaya. Oku kusenokubiza imali eninzi yaye kusenokungavisisani nenjongo yokubethelela imilinganiselo yentsapho. 

Nangona kunjalo, ukuba abazali basebenza ekhaya, imfundo yasekhaya iba yinto enokwenzeka ngakumbi kwaye ukuba nomzali okhoyo kunika imvakalelo yonqabiseko. Kwimeko yam, ukuba nomakhulu, oomakazi, kunye nam ekhaya kwandisa umthwalo kwaye kuvumele ukuba kwabelwane ngezakhono ezahlukeneyo.

Ndiyibonile impumelelo kamama ekukhuliseni amakhwenkwe kunye nendoda, kwaye ubuchule bakhe buxabisekile kum. Ngokufanayo, irekhodi likamama ngokukhulisa abasetyhini liyathetha

Ukuhlala kufutshane nosapho kubalulekile ukuze kusoloko kukho inkxaso. Kumava am, usapho luthembekile kwaye luluncedo ngamaxesha esidingo. Kwakhona kunciphisa usizi lokuhlukana nabazala kunye nokuqinisekisa ukuba unyana wam unonxibelelwano oluqinileyo kunye nosapho lwakhe.

Njengezibulo nendoda ekuphela kwayo, ndiziva ndinoxanduva lokuphumelela utata ndize ndinyamekele umama nabantakwethu. Nangona ndifundiswa esikolweni ukuba oku kuphelelwe lixesha, ndiyakholelwa ekubalulekeni kwemilinganiselo yosapho ngokusekelwe kumava am. Ngokugcina usapho lwam kunye nokubonelela imeko-bume efanelekileyo yokufunda ekhaya, ndiye ndabugcina ubulumko bukamama ndaza ndadala ikhaya apho unyana wam anokufunda khona.

7.4. Kungcono xa kukho ngaphezu komntwana omnye.

Kumava am, ndiye ndaphawula ukuba akukho nto inokuthatha indawo yokunxibelelana kwabantwana nokufunda koontanga babo. Izikolo ezisesikweni zinika abantwana ithuba lokunxulumana, lokukhuphisana, nokufunda omnye komnye. Ukuba bendifunda ekhaya umntwana wam ekuphela kwakhe, bendinokujongana nemiceli mngeni njengoko ebengayi kuba nonxibelelwano olufanayo noontanga bakhe.

Noko ke, ndiyambulela kuba engqongwe ngabazala bakhe abakwintanga enye. Bahlala bekunye kwaye bangaze badikwe okanye bangaphumli ekhaya. Bade bancedisane ekufundeni iikhonsepthi ezinzima ngendlela eyonwabisayo nangentsebenziswano. Kuyamangalisa ukubona ukuba izakhono zekhompyuter zikaMilande ziphucuka ngokukhawuleza kangakanani, ukuya kuthi ga kwinqanaba apho anceda abanye ngemicimbi yekhompyuter yabo.

Ukuba nomntu ofikisayo kumxube kuluncedo nako, njengokuba edlulisa izifundo esazifundisa kubazala bakhe nodade wabo. Phakathi kwabo, umtshana wam omncinane uzuza kakhulu ngokuba nabantwana abadadlana abaza kudlala nabo baze bamkhokele. Ukusekwa kwabantwana abaninzi kunye nabazali abaninzi kukwanceda ekuqeqesheni. 

Ngamanye amaxesha, kungakhathaliseki ukuba ndizama kangakanani na ukuba nonyana wam, andikwazi ukuxhathisa umtsalane wakhe ndize ekugqibeleni ndinikezele. Okuvuyisayo kukuba, xa umakhulu esithi "hayi," akukhathaliseki ukuba ndiye ndanikezela. Ngokufanayo, xa unyana akandonwabanga usoloko ekhona umntu apha efamilyni ozomphakamisa nokuba ngoo makazi bakhe, abazala okanye umakhulu wakhe.
Icandelo lesithathu: Siyenza njani ukuba isebenze.
8. IiMfuno zeHardware kunye neSoftware.

Enye yeenzuzo ezimbalwa zenkqubo yesikolo esesikweni kukuba inyamekela yonke imiba yamalungiselelo, ngoko abazali akufuneki bakhathazeke ngayo. Abazali banokukuphepha ukubandakanyeka kwimfundo yomntwana wabo, ingakumbi ukuba isikolo asisihle kangako. Izikolo kufuneka zamkele bonke abantwana, nkqu nakwizinto abazali ekufuneka bathathe inxaxheba kuzo. Abanakugxotha umntwana kuba befuna ukuthatha inxaxheba.

Abazali abanabantwana abakwinkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo badla ngokufuna kuphela ukuqinisekisa ukuba umntwana wabo uya esikolweni. Basenokukhetha ukuba nenxaxheba encinane kwindlela esisebenza ngayo isikolo. Urhulumente ngoku ulawula imfundo yasesikolweni, nto leyo eyahlukileyo kweyamandulo xa kwakusenziwa izikolo ngamalungu asekuhlaleni.

Imfundo yasekhaya ibandakanyeka kakhulu. Kufuneka ubandakanyeke kuyo yonke into!

Nangona imfundo yasekhaya ibonakala inzima ekuqaleni, inika amathuba amaninzi okonga imali kuba ihambelana nemisebenzi eqhelekileyo yasekhaya neyentsapho. Idesika esetyenziselwa umsebenzi wesikolo ekupheleni kosuku lwesikolo oluqhelekileyo lusebenza ngokufanayo kwimfundo yasekhaya, ukuba iyafuneka.

Ekugqibeleni, imfundo yasekhaya nemeko yekhaya isebenzisana kakuhle yaye iyingenelo kubazali nabantwana. Maxa wambi kuluncedo, yaye kuyimfuneko, ukufuna uncedo komnye umntu, kodwa izinto ezininzi ziyimbopheleleko yentsapho. Oku kunokufundisa intsapho izifundo ezibalulekileyo nobuchule obutsha.

8.1 IiMfuno zeklasi yaseKhaya.

Ukuba nedesika yokufunda ezinikeleyo kubalulekile kwiklasi yasekhaya enemveliso. Kufuneka ube nesitulo kunye nedesika exhasa ukuma kakuhle kwaye uvumele ukuhlala ngokukhululekile. Ukugcinwa okwaneleyo kweencwadi kunye namaphepha kubalulekile ukugcina ikhaya lakho lihlelekile. Ukukhanya okulungileyo kunye nokungena komoya kwakhona kubalulekile. Ngelixa ikhompyuter ilungile, akuyomfuneko njengoko izixhobo zokufunda zinokuthengwa kwiikopi ezibonakalayo kunye nezixhobo ze-intanethi zinokufikelelwa ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo.

8.2. IiMfuno zeHardware.

Ndithathe isigqibo sokubonelela umntwana ngamnye ngekhompyuter ukuze aqhubele phambili ukufunda kwakhe kwi-Intanethi nakwi-intanethi. Ubuncinane, umntwana ngamnye kufuneka abe nekhompyutha ekwaziyo ukuqhagamshela kwi-intanethi. Iimodem kunye neerouters ziyimfuneko ukuseka uxhumano lwe-intanethi kunye nesignali ye-Wi-Fi. Ukongeza, ukuba nomshicileli, nokuba yi-monochrome, iqinisekisa ukuba iincwadi zomsebenzi ezikhutshelweyo zinokuveliswa.

Ngelixa ukuthenga ikharityhulam ebonakalayo kunye nezixhobo zokufunda kunokunciphisa ukusetyenziswa kwekhompyuter, kusabalulekile ukufikelela kwizixhobo zamva nje ze-intanethi. Mna ngokwam ndiyakholelwa kwindlela edibeneyo edibanisa ungaxhunyiwe kwi-intanethi kunye nokufunda kwi-intanethi. Emva kwayo yonke loo nto, silungiselela abantwana kwikamva, kwaye izakhono zekhompyuter zibalulekile. Ndikhumbula ndiqala ukubamba ikhompyutha xa ndandineminyaka elishumi elinesixhenxe ubudala, kunyaka wam wokuqala kumabanga aphakamileyo!

Kule mihla, kukho iindlela ezininzi onokukhetha kuzo xa kuziwa ekuthengeni iikhompyuter, ukusuka kwii-smartphones kunye neetafile ukuya kwiilaptops, ii-Chromebooks, kunye needesktops. Isixhobo ngasinye sine-hardware yaso kunye nefom factor, ekhokelela kumahluko ekusebenzeni kwesoftware. Ke ngoko, ezinye izixhobo zifanelekile ngakumbi kwiinjongo zokufunda kwi-Intanethi kunezinye.

Ngelixa ii-smartphones kunye neetafile zinokuvelisa, ziyilelwe ngokuyintloko ukusetyenziswa kwemidiya kunye nokuzonwabisa. Ubungakanani babo obuncinci kunye nokunqongophala kweekhibhodi zomzimba kubenza bangalungeli kakhulu ukuzibandakanya kwekhompyuter yemihla ngemihla. Nangona kunjalo, ukusebenzisa i-smartphone okanye ithebhulethi ukufikelela kwimithombo yereferensi ye-intanethi kwamkelekile, kunye neetafile zikhethwa ngenxa yobukhulu bazo. Kubalulekile, nangona kunjalo, ukuphepha ukusetyenziswa ngokugqithiseleyo kwezi zixhobo ixesha elide. Ukujonga isikrini esincinci ixesha elide kunokutsala amehlo, singasathethi ngokuphazamiseka kokuchwetheza kwikhibhodi encinci.

Iilaptops, iChromebooks, kunye neeMacBooks zezona zikhetho zibalaseleyo, ngakumbi kwabo banendawo encinci okanye abahamba rhoqo. Bavumela abafundi ukuba bafunde naphi na apho bakhoyo, nangaphandle kwamakhaya abo. Iilaptops zinika uluhlu olubanzi lokukhetha, ukusuka kwiinketho ezifikelelekayo eziqhuba kakuhle ukuya kwiimodeli eziphezulu. Zisetyenziswa ngokubanzi ziinkampani ezinkulu, ziqinisekisa ukuba kukho ababoneleli abaninzi abakhoyo ukuze balungiswe kunye neenkonzo. Ukongeza, imakethi esetyenzisiweyo yeelaptops ibanzi, njengoko iinkampani ezininzi ziphucula izixhobo zazo emva kokuba zithotyiwe. Iilaptops ezihlaziyiweyo zihlala zikwimeko entle kwaye zinokuthengwa kubaboneleli abakhethekileyo.

Olunye uncedo lweelaptops kukukwazi ukuqhubeka nokusebenza ngexesha lokucima kombane, nto leyo ebaluleke kakhulu eMzantsi Afrika ngokucinywa kombane rhoqo. Nangona kunjalo, iilaptops zinokubiza kakhulu kune desktop kwaye aziphucuki ngokulula. Ukuphatheka kwazo kukwabenza babe sesichengeni somonakalo okanye ubusela, ngakumbi xa behamba ngezithuthi zikawonke-wonke.

Ii-Chromebooks, ezinenkqubo yokusebenza elula esekelwe kwisiphequluli se-Chrome, zifanelekile ukuba ziqwalaselwe. Ziyakhawuleza ngokukhawuleza ngaphandle kokufuna i-hardware ephezulu. Nangona bebekade begxekwa ngokugcinwa okulinganiselweyo, uninzi lwezicelo ngoku zine-online iinguqulelo ezenza ukuba ukugxekwa kungabi namsebenzi. Ukuba imemori eyongezelelweyo iyafuneka, ii-hard drives zangaphandle okanye ezinye izixhobo zokugcina eziphathekayo zingasetyenziswa. Nangona kunjalo, azikho iindidi ezininzi ze-Chromebooks ezikhoyo ekuhlaleni, ngoko ke ukuzingenisa xa ireyithi yokutshintshiselana ilungile inokuba lukhetho oluhle.

Iideskithophu lukhetho lwam endilukhethileyo ngenxa yexabiso labo eliphantsi xa kuthelekiswa neelaptops ezinengcaciso efanayo kunye nokulula kwazo ukuphuculwa. Logama nje ingezizo iiPC ezincinci okanye ezincinci, iimeko zekhompyuter ezikwiavareji zibonelela ngendawo eyaneleyo yokuphucula, kwaye uninzi lweemeko zivumela ukufikelela simahla kwesixhobo. Ubume obuzinzileyo bedesktophu bukwangqamana nokuba nendawo enikezelweyo yokufundisa nokufunda ekhaya. Oku kunceda ukunyanzelisa imithetho yendlu kunye nokuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bathatha ikhefu eliyimfuneko kwizikrini kwaye banamaxesha okutya okungenasiphazamiso.

Nangona kunjalo, iidesktops zinokuba zininzi kwaye zingenzeki kwiindawo apho indawo incinyiweyo. Ngelixa iiPC ezincinci zikhoyo, ubungakanani bazo obuncinci buhlala buncama ukuphuculwa. I-Raspberry Pi ihlukile, njengoko incinci kodwa inokwenziwa ngokwezifiso. Ukunqongophala kwebhetri yangaphakathi, iilaptops ezinayo, zinokuhlawulwa ngokusebenzisa unikezelo lwamandla olungaphazanyiswa.

Ukwabelana ngekhompyuter phakathi kwabantu abaninzi abasebenza ngexesha elinye kunokwenzeka ngehardware okanye isoftware elungileyo.

Elokuqukumbela, ngoxa ndinombulelo ngempumelelo ezuzwe ngenkqubo yesikolo emiselweyo, inyaniso ikukuba ndibe nenkoliso yeziseko eziyimfuneko ukuze ndisebenzise okona kulungileyo imfundo encinane enikelwa yinkqubo yesikolo. Ubungqina buxhasa kakhulu iziphumo ezibi zokuqaliswa kwekharityhulam esemgangathweni, kwaye kucacile ukuba iinzuzo zokufunda ekhaya ziyodlula le mingeni.

13.4. Amaxesha aguquguqukayo athintela ukuvuka kwangoko kakhulu.

Uphando lubonise ukuba akulunganga ukuba abantwana bavuke kwangoko kakhulu baye esikolweni. Abantwana abaneminyaka emithathu ukuya kwemihlanu badinga iiyure ezilishumi elinesithathu zokulala, abaneminyaka emithandathu ukuya kwelishumi elinesibini bafuna iiyure ezilithoba ukuya kwelishumi elinesibini, kwaye abafikisayo bafuna iiyure ezisibhozo ukuya kwezilishumi.

Ukungalali kakuhle kunokukhokelela kwiingxaki zempilo ezifana nesifo sentliziyo, uxinzelelo lwegazi oluphezulu, kunye nestroke. Kwakhona kunokubangela ukutyeba kunye nemiba yememori. Ukungabikho kokulala kuchaphazela ukufunda, ukuziphatha, kunye nempilo yonke yabantwana. Amaxesha okuqala esikolweni anxulunyaniswa nemiba yoluleko emikhulu kunye namanqaku asezantsi ovavanyo kubafundi abancinci.

Kubantwana abafikisayo, amaxesha okuqala kwangethuba enza kube nzima ukuba balale ngokwaneleyo kwaye kunokukhokelela ekuqhubeni kakubi esikolweni. Imfundo yasekhaya ibonelela bhetyebhetye ngakumbi kwaye ivumela ixesha elingakumbi losapho. Kukwanceda nocwangciso lwabazali lokulala, ngokukodwa kwiindawo ezineemoto ezininzi okanye xa indawo yokusebenza ikude nekhaya.

13.5. Ukuhamba okucuthiweyo.

NgoNovemba wamashumi amabini anesibini, inqaku le-Financial Mail labuza ukuba kutheni uMzantsi Afrika unawona mazinga mabi kakhulu okusweleka. Phakathi kukaJanuwari noMatshi amashumi amabini anesithathu, amawaka amabini anamakhulu amane anamashumi alithoba anesibhozo abantu abalahlekileyo kwiindlela zaseMzantsi Afrika. Abantu abaninzi, kuquka nabantwana, basemngciphekweni ngenxa yomgama omde abawuhambayo ukuya emsebenzini okanye esikolweni.

Izikolo ezininzi zasezilalini zivaliwe, nto leyo eshiya abantwana bengenandlela yakumabanga esikolo ekufutshane namakhaya abo. Ukuvalwa kwezi zikolo kubangelwe linani eliphantsi labafundi nanjengoko uninzi lolutsha lufudukela ezidolophini. Ngenxa yoko, abantwana kufuneka bahambe imigama emide, nto leyo eyandisa ingozi yeengozi.

Ukongeza, izikolo zikarhulumente ezixineneyo nezikumgangatho ophantsi kwiindawo zasezidolophini zikhokelela ekubeni abantwana basebenzise izithuthi ezingakhuselekanga. Iziganeko zokuxinana kweeteksi zeminibus zixeliwe, nto leyo ebeka abantwana emngciphekweni owongezelelekileyo. Ngaphaya koko, kukho ukwanda komngcipheko wokuba abantwana babe ngamaxhoba okurhweba ngabantu kunye nokuxhwilwa.

Le mingcipheko yinkxalabo yabazali, ngakumbi xa bexhomekeke kuthutho olungakhuselekanga kubantwana babo. Ngombulelo naluphi na ukhetho ngaphandle kwenkqubo yesikolo eqinileyo iyayinciphisa le nto ngemfundo yasekhaya ibe yeyona ndlela ilungileyo. Ukungahambi rhoqo kunciphisa umngcipheko wokuba sengozini yemoto.

14. Ingozi yokulinganisa isikolo esisemthethweni kunye nokufundisa kunye neziqinisekiso zolwazi.

Kusapho lwam, utata, nesatifikethi sakhe sebanga leshumi, wafumana umsebenzi oxabisekileyo emaphandleni aseTranskei, egqitha imfuneko yokusebenza emigodini njengabanye abaninzi. Umama, ngaphandle kwesiqinisekiso esisemthethweni, unokugqalwa njengongafundanga ngokwemigangatho eqhelekileyo. Ngaphandle kokushiya isikolo somthetho iikhredithi ezintathu ngaphandle kwesidanga sam se-LLB, ndiphumelele ngokwezemfundo ngaphezu kwakhe nabani na ongomnye kusapho lwam. Ndigqibe izifundo ezininzi ezikhethekileyo, ndibambe iDiploma yeSizwe kunye neBachelor of Technology.

Ngaphambili, bendibeka phambili ulwazi olusesikweni, oluchaziweyo ngaphezu kwamava angekho sikweni. Ndaye ndakholelwa ukuba kufuneka ndifikelele kwinqanaba elithile lomsebenzi ngaphambi kokuba ndibe nomntwana ukuze ndibanike okona kulungileyo. Oku kwandikhokelela ekubeni ndisebenze ngokuzimisela kuzinzo lwezezimali nokufikelela kwinkxaso yobungcali ekukhuleni nasekuphuhleni komntwana wam.

14.1. Ulwazi olungachazwanga kunye nobuchule obungenaziqinisekiso.

Ngokwengqungquthela ukungabikho kukamama iziqinisekiso ezisemthethweni kwakuthetha ukuba akanakuyinceda impilo nentlalontle yomntwana wam.

Ebeya kuba umakhulu onothando kuphela engenagalelo libambekayo. Kuba abazali bam bobabini baswelekelwa ngumama besebancinci, ndacinga ukuba andinayo i-experience yokuba nogogo ondizalayo so ndiye ndasebenzela abantwana bam babe nokufikelela kangangoko koomakhulu babo begazi.

Ndandingaqondi ukuba eyona qualification yakhe yayiyeyona ifanelekileyo, ekhulisa abakhe abantwana. Umama uye wabanyamekela ngempumelelo abatshana bam kunye nomtshana wam, ebonisa ukuba usenako ngokupheleleyo ukudlala indima ebalulekileyo ekukhuleni nakwintlalontle yabazukulwana bakhe. Nangona ndiphumelele kwizinto eziphathekayo, ngoku ndiyaqonda ukuba imigangatho eqhelekileyo 'yeyona nto ibhetele' ayibonisi oko kubaluleke ngokwenene.

14.2. Ulwazi olucacileyo kunye nobuchule obuqinisekisiweyo.

Unyana wombhali, uSazi, wakhuliswa ngumama wakhe kunye nomakhulu wakhe ozala umama, kamva waba ngumsebenzi wezempilo odla umhlala-phantsi oneziqinisekiso ezininzi kunye neSidanga seMasters watyunjwa ngumama wakhe ukuba ngumnonopheli wakhe oyintloko. Wayekwazi ukufikelela kwiingcali ezahlukeneyo zonyango kunye nokhathalelo olukhethekileyo ngoosiyazi, awayenabo ubuncinane abahlanu xa wayeneminyaka emihlanu ubudala.

Ngokungafaniyo nabazala bakhe, abafumana ukutya okuqhelekileyo komntwana kunye neemveliso zomntwana eziqhelekileyo, umama kaSazi wamisela kuphela iimveliso zeprimiyamu. Wavunyelwa ukuba atyelele ikhaya likayise ngo-Epreli amashumi amabini anesithoba, kunye nokutya okulungisiweyo, imiyalelo yokutya, kunye nomntwana ozinikeleyo. Ukutya kwakhe kwakuquka iyogathi engenaswekile, iidiliya, namaqebengwana erayisi anekhalori encinane.

Kuyo yonke lento uSazi uchithe iveki ezintlanu esibhedlele kunyaka wokuqala eqhubeleka nokulaliswa noba kukanye ngonyaka de abe neminyaka emithathu. Wacetyiswa ukuba abone ingcali yokuthetha xa ilibazisa ukuthetha, nangona ingenayo eminye imiba yophuhliso lomzimba.

USazi ubonane noogqirha abaninzi kunye neengcaphephe kunabo bonke abanye abantwana bedityanisiwe, umntu ongoyena mntu ubalulekileyo oqinisekisiweyo kodwa uneziphumo ezibi kakhulu zempilo. Ayikho enye indoda entsatsheni eyayifuna unyango lokuthetha nangona sonke sasilibazisa ukuthetha.

14.3. Ixabiso lamava obuqu ngaphezu kobuchule obuqinisekisiweyo.

Inkolelo yam ephosakeleyo yokuba imfundo esemgangathweni neziqinisekiso zilingana nemfundo yathotywa ngamava obomi bokwenene. Nangona echithe imali eninzi kuSazi kunabanye abantwana, iziphumo zakhe zazimbi kakhulu.

Nangona kunjalo, xa waqala ukuchitha ixesha elininzi kunye nosapho lukayise, impilo yakhe kunye nentlalontle yakhe yaphucula kakhulu. Inani lokuya kwakhe koogqirha lehla, yaye wasebenzisa amayeza ambalwa okubulala iintsholongwane. Ngoku utya ukutya njengabo bonke abantu abalapha endlini kwaye ukhula kakuhle. Ukuhleka kwakhe ngoku kuqhelekile njengabanye abantwana.

Xa uSazi wayene-allergies, ukuchitha ixesha kunye nomakhulu wakhe ongafundanga kwasebenza ngakumbi kunongenelelo olubiza kakhulu oluvela kwiingcali ezifundileyo. Wafumana isityalo egadini esanyanga ukwaliwa kwakhe.

Ngaphandle komtshana wam omncinci, wonke umntu oyindoda ekhaya ulibazise ukuthetha, eqala ngam. Nangona ndandinentetho ebambekayo ndisengumntwana, ndaba nempembelelo entle ekuphuculeni umgangatho wobomi kamama, oodade wethu nabantwana babo. Bonke baphila ngaphezu kwamandla abo, ngeendleko zam ndibanika umgangatho wobomi obulungileyo kunye nendawo engcono yokukhulisa abantwana babo.

Amava kaGqr. Sowell kwincwadi yakhe ethi "Late-Talking Children" andivula amehlo. Isakhono sikaSazi sokufunda ngaphandle kokufundiswa sihambelana neepateni zabantwana abathetha kade ezichazwe nguGqirha Sowell. Uphando lwakhe luthembekile kwaye luyahambelana.
Ubukrelekrele bokwenyani buxhomekeke kubuchule bomntu bokuzimela, kwaye emva koko aqhubeke nokubonelela abo babathandayo. Ndiye ndakwazi ukuzixhasa ukususela xa ndandineminyaka eyi-18 ngoncedo oluncinane oluvela kumama. Izenzo zam ziye zabuphucula ubomi bukamama nosapho lwam. Umgangatho wobomi bawo onke amalungu entsapho yethu uye waphucuka, kwaye anenkqubo yenkxaso yawona maxesha alungileyo nawona mabi.

14.4. Gqirha, ziphilise.

Abasebenzi bezempilo badla ngokubeka izilangazelelo zabo kuqala kunempilo-ntle yezigulana zabo. Oku kunokukhokelela kwiziphumo ezibi kumntu ngamnye nakwiintsapho.

Ngokwahlukileyo koko, abazali namalungu entsapho banembopheleleko yobuqu ekuqinisekiseni inyameko esemgangathweni kwabo babathandayo. Iingcali ezithembela ngokumfamekileyo zinokukhokelela kuxilongo olugwenxa okanye unyango olungasebenziyo.

Abezopolitiko kunye nabalawuli bakwamanye amaxesha basilela ukuphumeza izithembiso zabo. Kwelinye icala, amalungu entsapho achitha ixesha namandla awo ekunyamekeleni abo abathandayo. Ngokufuthi ukuzahlulela kwabo kuzisa umvuzo omkhulu nolwaneliseko. Abasebenzi bakarhulumente basoloko bekhethela bona neentsapho zabo iinkonzo zabucala, nto leyo ebonisa ukungathembeki kumsebenzi wabo.

Oku kuyinyani kwihlabathi jikelele, kunye nelona candelo lihluphekayo limele ipesenti ephezulu yamakhaya aphethwe ngabasetyhini angenandoda xa kuthelekiswa nemizi ekhokelwa ngabasetyhini nayo nayiphi na imizi ekhokelwa ngamadoda okanye amadoda. UMzantsi Asia unowona mlinganiselo uphantsi wamakhaya aphethwe ngabasetyhini kungekho ndoda kudidi olutyebileyo. Amakhaya aphethwe ngabasetyhini kunye nayo nayiphi na indoda ithande ukuba zizityebi kunezo zingenaye nayiphi na indoda kuyo yonke imimandla, ngaphandle kwaseMpuma nakumaZantsi eAfrika nakuMbindi Mpuma nakuMntla Afrika, apho ulwabiwo lobutyebi lufana phakathi kwemizi ephethwe ngabasetyhini nayo nayiphi na indoda nendoda. -imizi ephethwe.

Abantwana abakumakhaya aphethwe ngabasetyhini bajongana nokungalungi, ngakumbi xa kungekho ndoda ikhulileyo ekhoyo. Ubukho bomntu oyindoda, nokuba ngutata okanye umalume, kunempembelelo enkulu kwintlalontle yekhaya. Iisetingi zosapho ezandisiweyo zibonelela ngenkxaso kunye nokuzinza ngakumbi kubantwana xa kuthelekiswa neentsapho zenyukliya okanye amakhaya anomzali omnye.

Abantwana babelana ngezinto ezifanayo nezalamane zabo, nokuba bakhuliswe ngaphandle kwezalamane zabo. Amalungu entsapho eyandisiweyo anendima ebalulekileyo ekubumbeni ubuntu bomntwana nasekumnikeni inkxaso ebalulekileyo. Imekobume yentsapho eyandisiweyo isebenza njengolawulo kwaye inciphisa amathuba okuphathwa kakubi okanye ukungahoywa kwabantwana.

Ngamaxesha obunzima, inkxaso eqhelekileyo yentsapho eyandisiweyo inokunceda abazali bahlangabezane nocelomngeni. Ukukhuliswa kwintsapho eyandisiweyo kunika iinketho ezininzi kunye nenkxaso kumntwana xa kuthelekiswa nokuba kude nezalamane ezixhasayo. Ukuthembela kwiinkonzo zikarhulumente njengeyona nkxaso iphambili kunokuba mbi ngakumbi kunokukhuliswa kwikhaya eliphethwe ngabasetyhini.

15.4. Imodeli yekhaya lenyukliya kunye nentloko yabasetyhini ixhomekeke kubameli bangaphandle.

I-Newsweek inike ingxelo yobungqina kwishumi elinesithoba elinamashumi asibhozo anesithoba ukuba ukubeka iintsana kwindawo yokunyamekela abantwana kwiiyure ezingamashumi amabini okanye ngaphezulu ngeveki kunokuba yingozi ngenxa yenguqu ephezulu phakathi kwabakhathaleli kunye namazinga aphezulu ezifo. Noko ke, ukuxoxa ngezi ngxaki esidlangalaleni kwakujongwa njengento exhalabisayo, njengoko abanye babenoloyiko lokuba kunokusetyenziswa ukuthi ngoomama kuphela abanokunyamekela iintsana.

Abanye babekholelwa ukuba intsapho yesithethe iseyeyona ndlela ilungileyo yokukhulisa abantwana yaye oomama bayafuneka ekhaya. Ukuxhomekeka kwiingcali kunye namaqela angaphandle ekunakekeleni abantwana, njengoko kubonwa kulungiselelo lwentsapho yenyukliya, kubonwa njengento ephantsi.

Oku kuxhomekeka kukhathalelo lwangaphandle akukho nto intsha, kwaye usapho olongeziweyo luye lwakhula kwimbali nangona kukho ezinye iindlela zanamhlanje. Abagcini bendalo kudala belumkisa ngokuchasene nokuxhomekeka kumaqabane angaphandle ekukhuliseni abantwana. Akukho bungozi ekubekeni phambili abasetyhini kunye nokuba notata kunye nosapho olongeziweyo lokhathalelo lwabantwana ekhaya ngelixa umfazi eqhuba umsebenzi wakhe.

15.5. Imfundo yasekhaya ibhetyebhetye njengoko iintsapho zahlukene.

Kubalulekile ukunciphisa impembelelo embi yokwahlukana kwabazali kubudlelwane bomntwana nabazali bobabini kunye nosapho olwandisiweyo. Abantwana abangakumbi bazalelwa kwezi meko ngenxa yokuxhaphaka koqhawulo-mtshato, ukuhla kwamazinga omtshato, nabantu abakhetha ukuba nabantwana ngaphandle kobudlelwane.

Ngaphambili, abazali bam babenendima ecacileyo kulwalamano lwabo. Umama yena wayehlala ekhaya utata esebenza elungiselela usapho. Babesebenza kunye kuba babenobuchule neempawu ezahlukeneyo zokukhulisa abantwana.

Xa abazali bonyana wam badibana, sasisele singabantu abazimeleyo. Sasingathembeli omnye komnye kwimisebenzi eyenziwayo efana nokupheka nokucoca. Ekuphela kokuxhomekeka kwethu kuthando lothando. Nangona kunjalo, uthando lwezithandani lulodwa alufane lwanele, ukuba lukhona, ukugcina ubudlelwane.

Ukubhalisa umntwana kwisikolo esimiselweyo kunokunciphisa ixesha lakhe nomnye umzali, ngakumbi xa abazali bengekho kunye. Ukufunda kude kunye nokufunda ekhaya kubonelela ngeendlela ezingcono zabantwana kwezi meko.

Imfundo yasekhaya ivumela ukuba bhetyebhetye kunye nethuba lokuba abantwana bafunde kumalungu entsapho. Ikwavumela ootata ukuba bachithe ixesha elingakumbi nabantwana babo, njengoko banokuba neshedyuli ebhetyebhetye ngakumbi kunoomama ngemini yobuhlanga kunye nesini emsebenzini. Ootata banendima ebalulekileyo ekulungiseleleni abantwana iingxaki zobomi.

Imidlalo kunye nokuzivocavoca kunokuba luncedo kumadoda njengendawo yokuthengisa. Nangona kunjalo, imidlalo yesikolo iye yancipha kakhulu kwaye igxininisa ngakumbi kukhuseleko, olunokuthi lube luncedo kumakhwenkwe nakumadoda. Oomama badla ngokubeka kuqala ukhuseleko kunokulungiselela abantwana babo.

Iintsapho ezandisiweyo zinyanisekile ngakumbi kwaye ziphendulana. Kubalulekile ukuba bobabini abazali banyaniseke omnye komnye ukuze baqinisekise impilo-ntle yomntwana wabo. Ukunyaniseka kunceda ukubumba ubunyani bentsapho kwaye kuvumela ucwangciso olungcono.

Kubalulekile ukubamba umama wonyana wam kwaye unyaniseke kuye. Ndiyawathanda amava akhe njengokuphela komntwana, njengoko nonyana wam ekuphela komntwana. Ndiziva ndinoxanduva olukhulu lokuqinisekisa ukuba unyana wam uyakwazi ukufikelela kumava obomi bokwenyani kunye nokuzalana.

Ngokubanzi, kubalulekile ukunciphisa impembelelo engalunganga yokwahlukana kwabazali kwaye ubeke phambili impilo-ntle yomntwana.
Icandelo lesithandathu: Ekuvaleni, okwangoku.


16. Imfundo yasekhaya iyavakala, nakwabangabafundi basekhaya nakurhulumente.

Ngenyanga yeDwarha engamashumi amabini anesithathu, abemi boMzantsi Afrika babenokuninzi abakubhiyozelayo. Ngaphandle kokuphumelela embhoxweni, oyena nobangela uphawuleka kakhulu wokubhiyozelwa kukungaphazanyiswa kombane ovela kwa-Eskom, nto leyo ibiyinguqu entle ekucinyweni kombane rhoqo.

Ukuhamba kwezithuthi nako kuphuculwe ngenxa yezibane zendlela ezisebenzayo kunye nezibane zasezitalatweni. Ukongeza, abantu baye bafumana ukuzithemba ngakumbi ukuba iivenkile kunye neenkonzo ziya kuqhuba ngokuqikelelwa njengoko kufanelekile. Sekuyinto eqhelekileyo ukuba iindawo zivalwe ngesiquphe ngenxa yokucinywa kukagesi, nto leyo eshiya abathengi bexinezelekile. Ukonakaliswa kokutya bekungekho nto ixhalabisayo ngenxa yokucutheka kokumka kombane.

Ngaba olu phuculo lubangelwe kukutyumba kukamongameli umphathiswa wombane?

Hayi kufutshane!

16.1. Ityala elichasene nokubekwa kumbindi, ubonelelo ngoMbane njengomzekelo.

Abantu babucala eMzantsi Afrika bebethatha inyathelo lokunciphisa ukuthembela kwabo kwigridi yombane kwaye babhenele kwezinye iindlela zombane. Idatha ibonisa ukuba amakhaya kunye namashishini afake isixa esibalulekileyo sophahla lwe-PV yelanga.

Olu tshintsho kwimithombo yamandla yimpendulo ekucuthekeni kombane okuthe gqolo okwenzeka elizweni. Indlela urhulumente ajonga ngayo ukubonelela ngombane, u-Eskom njengoyedwa, ibe yingxaki ekuhlangabezaneni nemfuno eyandayo. Nangona kunjalo, abantu babucala abatyala imali kumandla elanga baye bakwazi ukubonelela ngombane kubo nakwabanye.

Oku bekuya kuba sisisombululo esifanelekileyo ekunciphiseni iindleko zokuhambisa umbane kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni apho amakhaya asasazeke ngokwahlukeneyo kunye nemithombo yamandla engenye efana neenkuni kunye nobulongwe benkomo isetyenziswa rhoqo. Imigaqo-nkqubo karhulumente kunye nokusilela ukujongana neemfuno zabahlali basemaphandleni kube negalelo kwintlupheko kwimimandla yasemaphandleni kunye nokufudukela kwiindawo ezidolophini.

Ukufakela iipaneli zelanga kuye kwaduma njengoko kuphucula ixabiso lepropati, kodwa oku akunakwenzeka kumhlaba wezizwe ngaphandle kwamalungelo afanelekileyo omhlaba. Uncedo lwangoku lokucuthwa kombane alubangelwa yimizamo karhulumente, kodwa izenzo zabantu babucala. Utyalo-mali lwabo lunceda bona kunye nabo bangenako ukuhlawula enye imithombo yamandla.

16.2. Ityala lemfundo yasekhaya, ukuze wonke umntu azuze.

English Translation,
The Homeschooling Father, Why and How I got started. 
Abridged
Preface.

The idea of formal schooling has become so ingrained in society that some are willing to mandate it through laws. This idea suggests that teachers, bureaucrats, and politicians should decide on our children's education instead of the parents. The BELA Bill threatens parents' control over their children's education by making decision-making power more centralized. 

Politicians feign concern for children's well-being to gain votes. Academics funded by taxpayer grants validate these ideas, and individuals appointed as experts and professionals profit by propagating the ideas of the politicians they serve, including through the national curriculum. Traditional values and the knowledge passed down through generations are disregarded in favor of progressive ideas. 

The consequence? 

South Africa in 2023, with high unemployment, crime rates, and more social grant recipients than taxpayers. Government services and state-owned entities are failing, schools and tertiary institutions are plagued by corruption scandals, and healthcare is unreliable. 

The formal schooling system has left the country with numerous social ills despite boasting the most educated generation. These problems are the result of supporting ideas that prioritize formal schooling over parental involvement. The system has failed, leading me to seek alternative avenues for my children's education. 

I acknowledge that my path may not work for everyone, but the arrogance that assumes formal education is suitable for everyone has caused significant harm. If positive outcomes in adulthood are not predominantly as a result of formal schooling, why do we invest significant time and money in it and willingly give up precious time with our children?

I refuse to subject my children to a failing formal school system, as though it is the only alternative. We all descend from ancestors who, until recently, never educated their children through formal means but instead focused on schooling their children at home informally. 

Recognizing this, I have sought alternative opportunities for my family. 


Part 1, Why?
The formal school system.

Home education is a time-honored method of educating children. It predates formal institutionalized schooling in all cultures and reflects a parent's desire to personally guide their child's education within the family home. This approach not only imparts the necessary knowledge, skills, and values for further education, employment, and active community membership, but it also offers flexibility and access to various learning resources.

The historical context of education in South Africa sheds light on the deep-rooted tradition of families and communities being the primary educators of children, providing them with essential skills for survival and community contribution. The commitment to this education was driven by a genuine interest in equipping children with practical skills, which in turn had tangible consequences for the family and the broader community. Even in the context of formal institutions and structured training, the significance of informal educational practices remains evident.

The transition from informal education to the introduction of formal schooling, initially through missionary schools, has given rise to the diverse range of educational institutions present today. However, the historical and cultural significance of home education and informal educational practices serves as a compelling reminder of the deep connection between education and community, reaching far beyond the confines of institutionalized learning.

1.1. Public vs Private Schools.

The funding and ownership determine whether a school is public or private. Public schools, or government schools, get most of their funding from taxpayers, while private schools are funded by the parents. 

Public schools in lower-income areas are free and have to accept all students, regardless of their financial situation or academic evaluations. Quantile 5 public schools can compete with top private schools because they have sufficient resources from the fees they collect.

Private schools operate independently of the government and can cater to specific religious or educational preferences. Premium schools, which refers to both private schools and premium paying quantile 5 public schools, claim to offer superior education but charge higher fees. 

Both public and private schools aim to provide education, with the conventional model involving attending a physical facility with set schedules and curriculum. Remote learning is an alternative that has historically been beneficial for working adults seeking to advance their education from a distance, and the internet has revolutionized this approach by enabling live attendance in remote classes, making the learning process more accessible for learners of all ages.

1.2. Formal Schools vs Distant Education vs Homeschooling.

It is important to emphasize that both formal and online schools offer the same educational content, differing only in the way they deliver it. Some public and private formal schools have hybridised to give some of their classes online, especially since the 2020 lockdown when access to school premises was limited.

Online schooling, also known as remote learning, should not be confused with homeschooling. Students who learn from home or any other location still follow the established school curriculum and adhere to the school's calendar and daily schedule, with parents playing an active role, just like in formal public or private schools.

Homeschooling is different from a home school, which follows a formal education model. In a home school, parents take on the responsibility of grading and assessment, assuming these tasks instead of the teacher.

Homeschooling gives parents a greater role as the primary educators, offering more flexibility in terms of the curriculum. Online resources and retailers provide the necessary materials, recorded or live classes, and assessment tools to support parents in this role.

Formal schools often face criticism for not recognizing the unique abilities of each student due to their standardized approach. This is where the eclectic curriculum comes in. This personalized curriculum is highly flexible and uses various teaching methods to cater to the specific needs and interests of each child.

The eclectic curriculum acknowledges that parents and family members have an intimate understanding of their children. Their unique qualities make them the ideal teachers for certain activities, creating a personalized learning experience. Just as children inherit physical traits from their parents and family members, they also inherit personality traits that can influence their preferred learning styles.

Considering that parents and family members can assess a child's abilities based on their upbringing, genetics, and their own abilities, they should have a significant role in shaping the curriculum.
Why I got started.

South Africa's education crisis was brought to light once again in 2023, revealing that more than 80 percent of grade 4 pupils struggle to read for meaning. This shocking statistic released from the 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) demands urgent attention. The poor state of reading ability among children attending tax-funded public schools has rightfully earned extensive media coverage, both domestically and internationally. The recurring trend of low reading proficiency over the years cannot be ignored, as it underscores the urgent need for effective and sustainable solutions to improve the country's education system. It is time for the government, particularly the Minister of Basic Education, to take full accountability and address the persistent issues that continue to impact the future of South Africa's children.

2.1. Problems with the Formal School System.

The issues facing the formal school system in South Africa are evident without the need to delve into academic research. Corruption is pervasive, diverting resources from schools and benefiting individuals. Moreover, infrastructure quality is often subpar, with some buildings deteriorating before completion. Beyond this, societal challenges such as crime, urban migration, and unemployment further compound the education sector's struggles.

These issues have direct ramifications on the employability of graduates, and South Africa's youth unemployment rate is staggeringly high. The Department of Higher Education has identified "lack of reading comprehension" as the top skill deficit in the labor market. Despite the Department of Basic Education's vision for a prosperous and democratic society, reality is far from this ideal.

The tax-funded formal school system has misused taxpayer resources and perpetuated societal division. The compulsory nature of formal schooling was achieved through legislative maneuvering, as the Constitution does not stipulate formal education as the sole means of providing basic education. This calls into question the legitimacy of forcing individuals into an educational system.

2.2. Premium public schools and private schools are the solution, right?

The proliferation of "race hustler consultancies" is being heavily criticized by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), which aims to uncover the practices of these "hustlers." Surveys conducted over the last two decades by the IRR have indicated that race-related concerns make up a small percentage of worries for South Africans, with issues like unemployment, crime, living conditions, and education being of far greater concern. This challenges the prevailing notion that racism is the biggest problem.

The idea that prestigious schools are inherently superior to lower-quality public schools is also questionable. Although elite institutions may appear to have a significant edge in offering top-notch education, it would be disingenuous to attribute their high pass rates solely to their accomplishments. This is because these institutions carefully select their students prior to admission and also impose financial barriers. Hence, it is crucial to acknowledge that their success cannot be solely accredited to their own merit.  

Moreover, accusations of racial discrimination against prestigious schools have led to expensive investigations, ultimately failing to produce evidence supporting these claims. Additionally, both public and private education are affected by socio-economic circumstances and affirmative action policies, with declining merit as the primary criteria for hiring in both sectors and an inability to terminate incompetent employees due to legal consequences.

Personal experience also contradicts the idea that attending prestigious schools guarantees success. Despite attending under-resourced public schools, I, along with my peers, have achieved a level of success and quality of life that challenges the notion of prestigious schools as an absolute advantage.

This led me to question what led to my success even though I went to poorly resourced schools? These thought-provoking insights challenge conventional beliefs about race issues and the superiority of prestigious schools, providing a compelling perspective on the true factors influencing educational and professional success.
Does the formal schooling system make sense at least?

If you've never explored concepts beyond what schools teach or delved into books outside the required readings, then you're missing out on the true essence of the world. The majority of people are simply programmed, not truly educated, to paraphrase International Keynote Speaker and Author Nicky Verd. 

Looking back on my own experience, I can now express my true feelings about school. I never questioned going to school as a child. It was as natural as breathing or the sky and earth, or so I was taught to believe. It was a necessity for survival, something you couldn't have an opinion about. However, now that I have the freedom to question and reflect, I realize that I disliked school. Ironically, my academic records may suggest otherwise. The truth is, I excelled academically because I wanted to escape the confines of school as quickly as possible. From a young age, I've always felt more at ease in the comfort of my own home. So, while school offered a form of learning, it often felt like a form of torture.

3.1. Things that don’t make sense about formal schooling.

Is the formal school education model the best for diverse learners? Growing up, I had to walk long distances to school, facing harsh weather and hazards. I mostly learned by listening to teachers and getting model answers for exams. Critical thinking was not encouraged. 
Sport activities were mandatory, even if not enjoyed or needed. Violence was common, despite beliefs that sports could help dissipate our aggressive tendencies as young boys.

Schools were seen as primary sources of childcare when parents worked, but considering today's soaring unemployment rates, this no longer holds water. In the past, many families relied on a single source of income, with one parent staying at home to care for the children. This arrangement proved advantageous for the well-being and development of the children.

In certain cases, when both parents are committed to formal employment, teachers have become surrogate caregivers. We are now witnessing the consequences of minimal parental involvement and the challenges faced by the generation that relied heavily on teachers.

The time I could have spent with my parents was limited due to school, which was even more difficult for me because my father passed away when I was 11. I had to leave home for a better education after his death. This made me want to understand the education system better, especially as I prepared to have my own children. I didn't want them to go through the same difficult experiences. The performance of school graduates after 1994 showed the negative impact of the education system.

3.2. At least the formal schooling system educates people, right?

If we were to admit that our educational journey shapes our identity and determines our future, as advocated by supporters of formal schooling, it would imply that individuals who have completed their schooling, such as high school, would achieve similar or at least comparable outcomes, given that they have undergone the same curriculum. One might assume that those who attended underprivileged public schools would have a minimum level of achievement, just as those who attended prestigious private schools would have comparable outcomes at the top. 

However, the reality is far from what we observe when looking at actual results, especially in a positive direction.

While school is a consistent part of life for many, its impact on an individual's success or failure is often overstated. It may be logical to think that individuals who attended similar schools would have similar or at least comparable outcomes, the truth is far different!

If formal schooling plays such a small role in people's outcomes, then why do we invest so much time and resources in it? Why do we sacrifice precious moments with our children as parents, knowing that we can never reclaim that time, just so they can attend school? How and when did we adopt this way of thinking?

In 2023, the situation might be even more concerning for the "born free" generation. A significant number of individuals from the post-1994 era have not only successfully completed primary and high school but have also chosen to pursue higher education at the tertiary level. This should lead to better success rates than previous generations with less schooling, as promised by formal schooling advocates.

The reality is quite the opposite. 

This generation, despite having more years of formal schooling, is actually faring worse than their predecessors. Many have become reliant on tax-funded support and are stuck in a cycle of unemployment. They have become perpetual burdens on taxpayers and their own parents. As a result, parents are facing uncertainty about their old age, as they have to work longer or rely on their retirement income to provide for both their children and grandchildren.

Historical Background of the formal education system.

It is important to recognize that practices such as religion and education are deeply ingrained in our culture, making them appear unquestionable and sacred. Yet, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that these practices can have significant and long-lasting negative effects.

In my pursuit of knowledge and understanding, I have dedicated a considerable amount of my leisure time to immerse myself in books and documentaries that shed light on these subjects. I have been both captivated and enlightened by what I have learned.

While I may not have always appreciated the study of history, I have come to love the valuable insights gained by examining the past. Discovering the context of my family's history and exploring the history of my community and humanity as a whole has proven to be incredibly relevant in shaping my future. In the year twenty twenty three, I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to delve into the captivating works of early writers who pioneered the practice of documenting and preserving records.

4.1. When and where did it all begin? 

The history of the current schooling system is vast and complex, but I will touch on the relevant aspects. Understanding the influential factors that have shaped the education system into what it is today is crucial. It has become a standardized factory model, stifling creativity and producing compliant individuals. This model is consistent not only in the West but also in South Africa.

Education and religion have always been closely connected. The first formal schools can be traced back to three thousand BC with the Sumerians and Egyptians, teaching students to read and write. By one thousand BC, religious schools in Syria were teaching the sacred Hebrew writings, but only the privileged few had access to them. Confucius opened the first schools for everyone, not just the elite.

With the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies, the demand for education grew. Children needed to learn the skills required for manual labor in agriculture. Obedience and reverence were emphasized, and a rebellious spirit could have dire consequences. The rise of the industrial age further increased the need for a compliant and obedient labor force.


4.2. Authentic beginnings to nefarious execution. 

Formal education was established with good intentions, aiming to improve society. However, it has been manipulated and exploited over time. The formal schooling system has been gradually distorted by individuals seeking personal gain, at the expense of the taxpayers using children as pawns. Martin Luther, a German priest, played a pivotal role in the implementation of compulsory schooling in Europe. His intention was to make the Bible more accessible to believers by advocating for public schooling.

Germany passed laws in the seventeenth century, making education compulsory and operated by the Lutheran church. In the eighteenth century, Germany had a tax-funded education system, which influenced other countries, including the United States. 

Industrialists in America sought to create a workforce that would obediently conform and not question those in power. Private institutions like the General Education Board, funded by wealthy industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, shaped the education system according to their own visions.

Government involvement in formal education increased with the establishment of tax-funded public schools. By the nineteen thirties, attending school became mandatory in American states. The vision of molding individuals to fit the needs of society and disregarding intellectual pursuits became prominent.

It is disheartening to see how initiatives with noble intentions can be twisted and perverted by individuals driven by self-interest. The formal schooling system, meant to empower and enlighten, has often fallen victim to such forces.

4.3. Formal schooling in South Africa.

According to Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, minister for native affair’s in the ninteen fifties the native department's education policy emphasized the importance of having education rooted in the native areas and communities of South Africa. It was crucial to guide the Bantu people to serve their own community and be self sufficient within. 

The historical development of the country's formal schooling system reflects the challenges faced by different racial groups. This historical context sheds light on the complexities and struggles of the South African education system.

From when the first formal schools were introduced by the Dutch Cape Colony to the involvement of the Christian church and the gradual shift of control from religious entities to the state demonstrate the changing dynamics of education. 

Historical influences have undoubtedly shaped and solidified formal education as a social standard, but the progress achieved has been undermined by economic, social, and political forces since ninenteen ninety four. Judged by the current status of the country, the formal schooling system has left the country worse off.
The real purpose of the formal education system, as measured by actual results.

Since nineteen ninety four, South Africa has seen a highly educated generation emerge, but the results of this increased schooling have not led to the expected improvements in the country. Despite higher enrollment rates and an emphasis on formal education, the country's performance in important areas like unemployment, crime rates, and economic growth has not met the promises made to taxpayers and parents. 

The education system has failed to equip graduates with practical skills, leading to a disregard for manual labor jobs and a lack of interest in practical trades. The disconnection between formal education and real-world capabilities is also seen in the lack of function within government entities staffed by graduates, many of whom have shown a propensity towards corruption rather than efficient service delivery. 

The political landscape has been marred by scandal and inefficiency, calling into question the effectiveness of the country's education system in producing responsible, competent citizens. As a result, South Africa finds itself in a difficult position, with the consequences of socialist policies and affirmative action further exacerbating the situation. 

In light of these realities, it is crucial to evaluate the true outcomes of the formal education system and question what it has actually achieved.

5.1. Plunder & Corruption.

The Budget review of twenty twenty one by the National Treasury reveals that the country's allocation towards learning and culture is projected to grow significantly over the next few years. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) receives the largest allocation out of all departments, a staggering sum of 255.1 billion Rands. However, it is evident that these taxpayer funds have been exploited for personal gain by the ruling party. 

The creation of additional ministerial positions in twenty ten within the education department has resulted in increased costs for the taxpayer, benefiting loyal party members. The government's justification for this split was to improve service delivery and efficiency. However, the results have been far from satisfactory. 

The basic education department has incurred irregular expenditure amounting to one point four billion Rands, and the Minister of Higher Education, who has held his position since twenty ten, has not shown significant improvement in his portfolio. The corruption and patronage extend beyond internal appointments, with tenders being awarded based on political connections rather than price or quality. 

This culture of corruption has permeated the education system, with reports of resource misappropriation, maladministration, and abuse of authority in schools. 

Even institutions with esteemed histories, such as UNISA and Fort Hare, have been tarnished by corruption allegations. The consequences of this corruption are dire, with lives being affected and even lost. The number of births among girls between the ages of ten to ninenteen, some of whom were impregnated by teachers and principals who abused their power, is alarming. 

It is clear that the education budget has been misused for personal gain, undermining the progress of the country. This deliberate exploitation of taxpayer funds for the ruling party's benefit is a betrayal of the Constitution and the people of the nation. The true objective of the school system was never to benefit the country as a whole, but rather to serve the interests of the ruling party.

The formal education system has been a very effective tool for politicians to plunder the country to regretion. 

5.2. Ensuring sustainable voting base.

Ensuring a sustainable voting base is crucial for political parties, especially those on the left that rely on promises of freebies and government assistance to secure votes. However, this strategy is not sustainable in the long run, as people become aware of the non-delivery of these promises and gain knowledge on libertarian policies that promote personal responsibility and freedom. To maintain power, the ruling party must find effective strategies to ensure their continued dominance.

One effective strategy lies within the schooling system. Contrary to popular belief, the poor quality of education is not simply due to incompetence, but rather a deliberate effort by the ruling party to undermine the system. By preventing graduates from acquiring sufficient knowledge and skills, the ruling party can maintain their deception and manipulate the masses through propaganda. This indoctrination begins at a young age, where students are taught to blame others for the government's failure and accept policies that promote equality through high taxes and racial division.

The government also ensures that individuals become dependent on social assistance, creating a reliance on the ruling party for their livelihoods. These grants, although initially introduced as temporary, rarely allow recipients to break free from their dependence. By keeping individuals reliant on the government, the ruling party gains lifelong supporters who will continue to vote for them, ensuring their stay in power.

The formal schooling system plays a crucial role in this strategy. Despotic governments prioritize and make education mandatory in order to indoctrinate citizens and secure their loyalty. The hard-left ideology that has accelerated the demise of the West and threatens humanity's future has been entrenched through formal education, with constant repetition of false narratives and half-witted ideologies. It is concerning that the most radicalized individuals are often graduates of prestigious institutions, who should know better but actively exploit others. Even divisive and destructive movements like Black Lives Matter, embraced by politicians, have been led by individuals who have benefited from an affluent education.

It is no coincidence that most college professors identify as liberal, as they play a key role in radicalizing graduates and distorting natural truths. The reciprocal relationship between politicians, government officials, and intellectuals further perpetuates this indoctrination. Politicians depend on intellectuals to give credibility to left-wing policies, while intellectuals are rewarded with taxpayer-funded grants and other opportunities for self enrichment.

Overall, the education system is a powerful tool for creating dependency and brainwashing citizens. 

5.3. Weakening the influence of parents.

My parents always believed in the importance of education, although they equated it with formal schooling. I enjoyed learning as a child and saw how education helped my father provide for our family.

However, I began to question why some children resisted going to school. There were parents who strongly resisted and voiced their concerns about school depriving their children of valuable learning experiences in the real world. This is when I realized that the government was legally forcing children to attend school, which confused me. If going to school is so beneficial, why the need to make it compulsory?

Why would one need to be forced to do what is good for them? No laws have ever been required to compel people to eat or breathe; all living entities instinctively know this and do it. Rather than people wasting because they are not eating, obesity is a problem in prosperous countries. Laws are enacted to restrict eating certain foods because all living entities know nutrition is necessary, thus always seek it.

The government's emphasis on mandatory education has resulted in a reduction of parental control over their children, which was the intended objective from the start.

There has been no greater tool to facilitate this weakening of the parent’s authority than the school system. The situation has become extremely alarming, with supporters of the education system advocating for children to start attending school at a younger age. Parents are often told that early childhood education is beneficial because it allows them to work while their child learns.

Studies and practical observation have demonstrated that the advantages of early childhood education not only have a fleeting impact, but also have genuine adverse consequences for both the child and parents.

5.4. The Significance of Community in the Family Context.

Today, the concept of "community" is often misinterpreted and used to force individuals into shouldering the burdens associated with public education. Therefore, it becomes essential to establish a clear definition of what truly constitutes a community. Let me illustrate this by sharing examples from my own village and family.

I was born in Fort Malan, a rural village located around ten kilometers from the Eastern Cape shore. In this village, the homes of my close relatives were situated in close proximity, with kinship ties diminishing as the distance increased. This pattern is mirrored in my father's village, Nqabane, where immediate family members also reside in close proximity. 

Growing up, whenever I visited these villages, I felt a strong bond with the people due to our shared family ties. These connections instilled in me a deep sense of belonging. This strong sense of community stemmed from the historically low influx of outsiders and the prevalent practice of intermarriage within the villages. As a result, every parent in the community felt a vested interest in the welfare of all children, bound together by kinship ties.

This united community worked together and invested in a common goal. The composition of these communities remained relatively stable, with few external individuals joining. This sense of stability instilled confidence in the "investors" that their future generations would also reap the benefits.

The first schools I attended, were primarily built through the collective efforts of the community. Parents pooled their resources and construct to build what the government couldn’t. 

Despite the limited financial resources, the community took great pride in working together and accomplishing what they could. I don't recall instances where individuals intentionally damaged school property because they would also be harming something they helped build, and they were related to someone who would be affected by the damage. 

These communities were tightly-knit and dedicated to shared objectives, driven by their long-standing familiarity with each other across generations and the limited movement of people in and out of the villages.

The same definition of community cannot be applied to present times, especially on a national scale, let alone international.  

In light of these changes, it becomes unrealistic to expect individuals to help strangers they don't know and likely will never encounter. These strangers could either be friends or foes, making it difficult for them to be accepted in new villages.
Part 2: Where I began
Homeschooling and the Law, The South African Constitution
The South African Constitution is the supreme law of the country, any law that is inconsistent with it is invalid. It guarantees the right to basic education for everyone. The Constitution doesn't define what qualifies as basic education, leaving it up to parents and legal guardians to decide. 

The state must implement this right using reasonable measures, and if these measures are found to be unreasonable, the Constitution prevails. The Constitution also recognizes the parents and family as the primary caregivers for children and only allows for alternative care if there are legitimate reasons to believe it is necessary. 

As a parent, I have the right to object to formal schooling if it interferes with my responsibility to care for my child. It is difficult to justify taking children away from their parents and having them taught and cared for by strangers, unless the parents and family have been declared a danger to the child.

6.1. Am I breaking the law by not sending my child to a formal school?

Absolutely not. The right to homeschool is protected by the Constitution and the Schneider case has made it clear that noncompliance with specific legislation will not be considered a breach. 

This raises questions about the Department of Basic Education's authority to regulate homeschooling. The South African Schools Act, for instance, mandates formal school attendance from the age of 7 to 15 and imposes fines or imprisonment for noncompliance. Section 51 also requires parents to register homeschooled children. 

The ruling party and its allies are attempting to pass the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill, which aims to push children into a failing formal education system. This bill has faced opposition from various groups, including AfriForum and the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), who argue that it centralizes power in the hands of the State and undermines community involvement in schools. Many parents, along with organizations like the Pestalozzi Trust, are standing up against this bill. Opposition parties such as Freedom Front Plus (FF+), the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), and the Democratic Alliance (DA) have also expressed strong opposition. 

The government has been relentless in its efforts to discourage homeschooling, but parents and advocacy groups are fighting back. Education officials in KZN have even been making it difficult for parents to register for homeschooling, prompting the Pestalozzi Trust to take legal action.

6.2. Homeschooling and the South African Constitution.

Although Section 29 may initially seem like the most relevant section to explore homeschooling in South Africa, it is actually Section 28 of the Constitution that holds the utmost importance. This section establishes the tone and serves as a guiding principle, prioritizing the well-being and best interests of the child in all matters concerning them.

In November 1989, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) was adopted and came into force the following year. South Africa signed the Convention in 1993 and ratified it in 1996. Article 3 of the Convention specifically addresses the best interests of the child, stating that it should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children.

The Convention also recognizes the importance of the family as the fundamental social group and the natural environment for children to grow and thrive. It emphasizes the need for the family to receive the necessary support to fulfill its responsibilities within the community.

Given the issues faced by the Department of Basic Education (DBE), it is unclear how anyone could argue that formal schooling is the best option for a child, especially when there are superior alternatives available. Various indicators demonstrate that the department fails even in its basic mandate of teaching basic literacy and numeracy. 

Consequently, the government, through the DBE, has failed to act in the best interest of the child as required by the UNCRC.

Central to all of this is the recognition that every child has fundamental rights, including the right to life, survival, and development; protection from violence, abuse, or neglect; an education that enables them to reach their full potential; the ability to have a relationship with both parents, even if they are separated; the right to express their opinions and be heard; the protection of their privacy; and the assurance that their lives are not excessively interfered with.

6.3. What is Basic Education?

Politicians and governemnt beaurocrats have misled parents into thinking that formal schooling is the sole option for educating their children, and the Department of Basic Education is complicit in this. The portrayal of dissent as illegal and attempts to discourage alternative education methods are concerning, especially in light of the dismal state of the formal school system.
The definition of school as formal schooling in legislation contradicts the Constitution, which takes an adequacy-based approach to defining basic education. Parents are key in defining basic education, and various institutions and individuals, including lawmakers, policymakers, teachers, learners, and community organizations, contribute to shaping the understanding and application of the right to a basic education. Defining this right is ultimately a democratic and cooperative endeavor.

6.4. Other Countries and the International Perspective.

In countries where compulsory education is enforced, it is enshrined in their highest law. Homeschooling is legal in many other countries, as extensively covered by SA Homeschoolers.

The South African Constitution recognizes the pivotal role of parents in their child's education. Therefore, it ensures that compulsory schooling is not the only means of providing basic education. Other sections of the Constitution also safeguard and promote the important role of parents and families.

Departure Point.  

I thought about my own experience in public schools when deciding if homeschooling was right for my children. I used to think that my success in life was solely due to my formal education; however, if that were the case, then everyone who went through similar schooling should achieve the same level of success at least.

However, when I compared the outcomes of individuals who had similar educational backgrounds, I realized that similar success was not the norm but the exception. In fact, many individuals who achieved extraordinary material success lacked formal education in their respective fields. 

This observation challenged the belief that the school system had a significant influence on individuals. Many successful people in South Africa have had little or no formal education. It became clear to me that the fundamental essence of success lies in the ability to continue one's lineage and provide for the next generation. 

The impact of formal schooling, which has only existed for a relatively short period of time, is grossly overrated. Reflecting on my own upbringing, where my parents prioritized education and provided learning resources at home, I realized the importance of these qualities and wanted to amplify them through homeschooling.
  
7.1. School background of the parents versus post school progress.

When selecting the optimal education options for our children, it was crucial to take into account the educational background and parenting styles that were imparted to us as parents, and how they align with the progress we have accomplished after schooling. The complementarity of the sexes, essential for child conception, remains equally important after the child is born. It allows parents to compare and contrast their own childhood experiences and understand how they shaped their adulthood.

For the longest time, contrary to reality formal school teachings often emphasized the influence of nurture over nature, disregarding the impact of genetics. It was believed that the environment determined one's identity, echoing John Broadus Watson's views.

Yet, in reality, the role of genetics in shaping personality traits cannot be overlooked. Notably, the significance of nature in addition to nurture has been highlighted by various experts, such as Dr. Mark Leary and Steven Pinker. This is particularly relevant for Sazi, who can witness the effects of both nature and nurture due to the comparable backgrounds of his parents.

Moreover, societal efforts to promote women's progress have been substantial, aiming to eliminate barriers that hindered their advancement. Consequently, there should no longer be a bias favouring men being more successful, making it feasible to compare outcomes between genders.

Our upbringing was so different that we can now evaluate its impact based on our outcomes. She grew up in urban Port Elizabeth went to a premium school that emphasised Christian values and changed schools once. I grew up in rural Transkei, attended public schools without fees, changed schools 5 times, and spent the last 4 years in Mpumalanga, where the school had the lowest matric pass rate in its district in 2022. My son's mother's alma mater had a pass rate of 100%. Out of that, 94.6% were eligible to pursue degree courses in college.

Given that we grew up in completely different environments, one would expect a significant disparity between us as adults. And indeed, there is a significant difference, although not in the way one might anticipate. The assumption that attending better-resourced schools would guarantee better outcomes is challenged by the actual results. This realisation not only challenges the inherent superiority of traditional premium schooling but also underscores the inefficacy of making substantial additional investments in it beyond a certain point.

In conclusion, the exploration of parental backgrounds, formal education, and personal achievements serves as a revelation, challenging conventional beliefs and highlighting the limitations of defining success by material means.

7.2. Personality of the child and parents.

While many people find enjoyment in participating in sports and recreational activities at school, I, personally, never shared the same enthusiasm. I lacked interest in sports and my tendency to have nosebleeds even with the slightest physical exertion didn’t help. 

Beyond the school environment, I also had little desire to spend time with other children, thanks in part to my mother's strict routine. While my peers had the freedom to play until late and roam without restraint, my home life was quite different. We adhered to a strict routine:
Wake up early in the morning and head straight to school.
Return directly home after classes with no detours.
Finish all household duties and ensure tomorrow's uniform is prepared, including polished shoes.
Play outside in the yard with other children.
Return before 6 pm to ensure the gate doesn't get locked.
Complete homework before bedtime.

We did not have any livestock at home. This meant that opportunities for socialising while tending to the cows in the grazing fields were close to nonexistent. During my teenage years we harvested rainwater, reducing the need to go to the river. However, this also meant fewer chances to interact with other children. Even in high school, I grew accustomed to my parents' routine, choosing to remain close to home instead of venturing out, despite the newfound opportunities.

As an adult, few things annoyed me as much as people who equated having a fulfilling life with constantly going out. To this day, there is nowhere else I would rather be than at home, which has, over time, transformed into not just a place of comfort but also my workplace. Despite the challenges brought about by the unjust government-imposed lockdowns and intrusive measures during the Covid pandemic,, it has also presented unforeseen advantages. One of these is the surge in remote working and remote learning.

Many others have come to appreciate the home as a primary space for both work and education. This reaffirms my decision to pursue a different path when it comes to my children's education.

7.3. The family environment.

Before traditional schools became widespread, families played the role of education. Most families lived together in one area, with grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives. This created a supportive environment where children were taken care of while adults worked, and they learned practical skills from family members.

In a family home, everyone is invested in the child's success, unlike in public or private schools where the focus may be on financial gain. While some may argue that salary is an important motivator for teachers, the benefits of homeschooling include the reinforcement of family values. 

Homeschooling can be challenging for single parents or couples with work commitments, as it may require hiring someone to take care of the child and provide homeschooling. This can be expensive and may not align with the goal of instilling family values. However, if parents work from home, homeschooling becomes more feasible and having a parent present provides a sense of security. In my case, having my grandmother, aunts, and myself in the home spreads the workload and allows for a variety of skills to be shared.
I have witnessed the success of my mother in raising boys and a man, and her expertise is invaluable to me. Similarly, my mother's track record with raising women speaks for itself

Living close to family is important so that there is always support available. In my experience, family has been reliable and helpful in times of need. It also reduces the sadness of parting with cousins and ensures that my son has a strong connection with his extended family.

As the firstborn and only male, I feel a duty to succeed my father and take care of my mother and siblings. Despite school teaching me that this is outdated, I believe in the importance of family values based on my own experiences. By keeping my family together and providing a conducive environment for homeschooling, I have retained the wisdom of my mother and created a home where my son can learn.

7.4. Better when there’s more than one child.

In my experience, I have observed that there is no substitute for children interacting and learning from their peers. Formal schools provide children with the opportunity to socialize, compete, and learn from each other. If I were to homeschool my only child, I might face challenges as he wouldn't have the same interaction with his peers. 

However, I am grateful that he is surrounded by his cousins who are in the same age group. They keep each other company and never get bored or restless at home. They even assist each other in learning difficult concepts in a fun and collaborative way. It's incredible to see how quickly Milande’ss computer skills are improving, to the point where he now helps others with their computer issues. 

Having a teenager in the mix is beneficial too, as he passes down the lessons we taught him to his cousins and sister. Among them, my youngest nephew benefits the most from having older children to play with and guide him. The multi-generational and multi-parent setup also aids in discipline. Sometimes, no matter how firm I try to be with my son, I can't resist his charm and end up giving in. Thankfully, when grandma says "no," it doesn't matter that I gave in. Similarly, when my son is unhappy with me, there is always someone in the family to lift his spirits, whether it's one of his aunts, cousins, or his grandmother.
Part 3: How we make it work. 
Hardware and Software Requirements.  

One of the few advantages of the formal schooling system is that it takes care of all the logistical issues, so parents don't need to worry about them. Parents can avoid being involved in their child's education, especially if the school is not very good. Schools must accept all children, even in activities that parents must participate in. They can't expel a child to force their participation.

Parents with children in the formal schooling system usually only need to make sure their child goes to school. They can choose to have little involvement in how the school works. The government now controls formal education, which is different from the past when schools were created by community members.

Homeschooling is very involved. You have to be involved in everything!

Even though homeschooling seems demanding at first, it offers many opportunities to save money because it aligns with regular household and family activities. The desk used for schoolwork at the end of a regular school day works just as well for homeschooling, if it's even needed.

In the end, homeschooling and the household environment work well together and benefit both parents and children. Sometimes it's helpful, and even necessary, to get help from someone else, but most things are the family's responsibility. This can teach the family important lessons and new skills.

8.1 Home Classroom Requirements.

Having a dedicated study desk is important for a productive home classroom. You should have a chair and desk that support good posture and allow for comfortable sitting. Adequate storage for books and papers is essential to keep your home organized. Good lighting and ventilation are also important. While a computer is convenient, it's not necessary as learning materials can be purchased in physical copies and online resources can be accessed through various means.

8.2. Hardware Requirements.

I decided to provide each child with a computer to facilitate their learning both online and offline. At the very least, each child should have a computer that can connect to the internet. Modems and routers are necessary to establish the internet connection and Wi-Fi signal. Additionally, having a printer, even a monochrome one, ensures that hard copy workbooks can be produced.

While purchasing physical curriculum and learning materials can reduce computer usage, it is still crucial to have access to the latest online resources. I personally believe in a hybrid approach that combines offline and online learning. After all, we are preparing the children for the future, and computer skills are essential. I remember the first time I touched a computer when I was 17 years old, during my first year of tertiary education!

Nowadays, there are many options to choose from when it comes to purchasing computers, ranging from smartphones and tablets to laptops, Chromebooks, and desktops. Each device has its own hardware and form factor, leading to differences in software functionality. Therefore, some devices are more suitable for online learning purposes than others.

While smartphones and tablets can be productive, they are primarily designed for media consumption and entertainment. Their smaller size and lack of physical keyboards make them less ideal for daily computer engagement. However, using a smartphone or tablet to access online reference resources is acceptable, with tablets being preferable due to their larger size. It is important, though, to avoid excessive use of these devices for extended periods. Staring at a small screen for a long time can strain the eyes, not to mention the inconvenience of typing on a small keyboard.

Laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks are excellent options, especially for those with limited space or who travel frequently. They allow students to learn wherever they are, even outside of their homes. Laptops offer a wide range of choices, from affordable options that perform well to high-end models. They are widely used by big companies, ensuring that there are ample suppliers available for repairs and services. Additionally, the used market for laptops is extensive, as many companies upgrade their devices after they have been depreciated. Refurbished laptops are often in good condition and can be purchased from specialised suppliers.

One advantage of laptops is their ability to continue working during power outages, which is particularly relevant in South Africa with frequent load shedding. However, laptops can be more expensive than desktops and are not as easily upgradeable. Their portability also makes them more vulnerable to damage or theft, especially when commuting using public transportation.

Chromebooks, which have a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser, are worth considering. They are relatively fast without requiring high-end hardware. Although they used to be criticized for limited storage, most applications now have online versions that make the criticism irrelevant. If additional memory is needed, external hard drives or other portable storage devices can be used. However, there is not much variety of Chromebooks available locally, so importing them when the exchange rate is favorable might be a good option.

Desktops are my preferred choice due to their lower cost compared to laptops with similar specifications and their ease of upgradability. As long as they are not mini or small factor PCs, average computer cases provide ample space for upgrades, and most cases allow for tool-free access. The fixed nature of a desktop also aligns with having a dedicated space for teaching and learning at home. This helps enforce house rules and ensures that children take necessary breaks from screens and have distraction-free meal times.

However, desktops can be bulky and not practical in spaces where space is limited. While mini-PCs are available, their small size often sacrifices upgradability. The Raspberry Pi is an exception, as it is relatively small yet highly customizable. The lack of an internal battery, which laptops have, can be compensated for by using an uninterrupted power supply.

Sharing a computer between multiple people working at the same time is possible with the right hardware or software. With the Aster Multiseat software one computer can service multiple people with just the addition of peripherals. One drawback of shared computers is that if one child is not using the computer, it cannot be turned off individually, as it shuts down for both users simultaneously. The child who is not using the computer must log out. 





The Curriculum.

My vision for my children's education always involved a risk based approach, but it wasn't until the COVID lockdowns that I took decisive action. Within three months, we made the conscious choice to embrace online schooling, knowing we had the necessary resources to support this new venture.

Initially, I mistakenly blurred the lines between homeschooling and attending an online school from home. I failed to fully comprehend the distinct nature of homeschooling, neglecting to consider the curriculum and its delivery. My knee-jerk reaction was to adopt a distance learning model, with someone else providing the curriculum.

Although it wasn't true homeschooling, this approach greatly facilitated the transition. This allowed us to assess if homeschooling was suitable for my nephew, who had previously attended public schools and was in fifth grade. It was vital that the transition be gradual. By following a standard curriculum, attending structured online classes, and having dedicated teachers, we were able to determine if homeschooling was the right fit for him.

9.1. Available curriculums.

Online schooling in South Africa offers the same components as formal schooling but with the flexibility of learning from home. There are three curriculum options available: Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) used in public schools, Independent Examinations Board (IEB) for private schools, and Cambridge Assessment International Education. 

There are service providers who sell the full homeschool kit with all the required material to help a parent and the learner. These packages range from five thousand to under ten thousand rands in twenty twenty one. Opting for online schooling provides a high-quality education at a more affordable cost compared to prestigious private schools.

9.2. Homeschooling.

To optimise homeschooling, integrate education into a child's routine and focus on developing relevant skills instead of just following a set curriculum. Our lessons now synchronize with our family's activities and what's happening in the world.

My nephew's classes have become more like research sessions rather than live lectures. He learns by actively doing things, like designing and building models to understand angles. He also learns IT skills, both hardware and software, through hands-on experiences.

Homeschooling has been a great experience for me, my mother, and my sisters. We constantly learn and refresh our knowledge as teachers, and we enjoy it. The children's enthusiasm for learning has also inspired other adults in the house.

Since twenty twenty one, we've been growing our own vegetables in my mother's garden, which has become a significant source of fresh produce. The children actively participate in gardening, which not only nourishes their bodies but also enriches their minds. The quality of our food has improved, and it has even sparked an interest in cooking for my nephew and the younger children.

Before, we hired others to do most of the building and maintenance work for our house. But now we have a workshop for carpentry, welding, plumbing, and more. As we engage in these activities, our knowledge and skills expand. Thankfully, there are many free online resources available for gaining knowledge if you're willing to put in the effort to research.
Online Resources.
People often focus on obtaining qualifications from the school system to become more knowledgeable, leading to a focus on obtaining qualifications rather than gaining knowledge. This has led to an increase in high-ranking government officials and politicians fabricating their qualifications, which has spread throughout society due to moral decay. 

The structure of formal schooling sometimes leads individuals to try to avoid it. Kids pretending to be sick to skip school is nothing new. But why do we try so hard to avoid something that helps us learn and brings many advantages? 

The reality is that the knowledge we gain in school often doesn't stick with us for very long. There are many videos on social media where people struggle to recall basic knowledge they learned in school, even just a year later. An article revealed that only 55 percent of teachers can perform at a fourth-grade level. Teachers, who have gone through the same classes they teach, struggle to remember what they learned. 

If teachers can't remember what they learned, imagine how much harder it is for individuals who studied trigonometry in high school but haven't used it in ten years. For many teachers, once they have the necessary qualifications and a job, there is no motivation for them to stay knowledgeable in their subjects. They don't have to worry about their students' performance reflecting on them during evaluations because the process is shallow. There are low standards for students to pass to the next grade. These policies discourage failing students and create a lack of motivation for teachers to be competent.

10.1 Free & Low-cost Online resources.

One can acquire education for free from prestigious institutions and professionals through the internet. Many highly ranked institutions worldwide offer free content and access to professionals through social media. There are numerous websites, apps, and resources from teaching institutions, profit and nonprofit entities, and government websites that provide free learning materials. 

Academic search engines and basic search engines like Google Scholar and Google offer research papers for free. Video sharing sites like YouTube and educational television channels also provide free educational content. Additionally, many online learning platforms offer resources for all ages, some of which are freely accessible. While these options don't offer completion certificates, they provide ample opportunities for knowledge seekers.

Van Warmelo Collection on University of Pretoria website offers free access to historical documents about the indigenous people of South Africa. Original manuscripts are transcribed by South African Heritage Publishers for easier access at less than R400 a year.

10.2 Online security and productivity tools.

As a compliance practitioner, I have worked closely with cybersecurity and have learned the importance of online safety. Linux offers the best value for money in this regard as it does not require an antivirus. However, Windows is popular with hackers, so antivirus and online protection are important. 

To ensure online security and productivity, we use software from the proprietors directly or the official app stores for the operating system. Linux comes with most software for browsing, word processing, and other productivity software, as well as the app store. Software downloaded illegally or from unscrupulous sites often contains additional applications that may slow down your computer or install viruses and malware.

Using an official operating system that is supported for security upgrades is essential. Most devices have a defined period during which the manufacturer will commit to providing updated security patches. Antivirus, firewalls, and network protection are not necessary for Linux, but they often come with built-in options.

Child monitoring and productivity software like Microsoft Family and Google Family-link are great productivity tools to provide an added layer of security and monitor a child's online activities. These tools can create child-specific profiles for age-appropriate content, set up school time, and provide daily/weekly/monthly progress reports.

To limit risks, we have setup passwords and dedicated workstations, installed extra extensions to block social media sites, and used a dedicated operating system focused on learning. Self-monitoring between children is also essential, as they can easily notice if something is amiss while we are focused on our work.

10.3. Educational Websites.

Educational websites and applications have made accessing resources much easier and more convenient. In the past, libraries were limited in terms of location and resources, making it difficult for many people, especially those in rural areas, to access books and other materials. However, the internet has changed this by providing accessibility to educational resources regardless of one's location. 

Although some educational websites may require a subscription fee, many are free to use.

While navigating the vast amount of information on the internet can be overwhelming, paid educational websites offer the advantage of organising and grouping information for easy navigation. This is particularly beneficial for homeschoolers as the websites are structured based on subject, grade level, and age group. In contrast, free websites often have distractions and advertisements that can be inappropriate for children, posing a security risk.

One highly recommended educational website is education.com. While they offer a free version, the paid subscription provides a wide range of resources such as worksheets, games, and lesson plans. It caters to students from Pre-K to 8th grade and allows for the creation of multiple profiles for each child. The website also has a classroom mode for up to 35 students, making it ideal for homeschooling families. Activities can be assigned individually or as a group, and progress can be easily tracked. The website is user-friendly on both mobile devices and desktops/laptops.

education.com has a simple interface and the ability to schedule activities in advance, allowing for easy planning and supervision. Additionally, family members can be added as students to help supervise, review content, and monitor progress. This collaboration ensures that the assigned material is age-appropriate and aligns with the family's values.

10.4 Websites vs Mobile Applications.

Online resources, websites, and mobile applications offer the advantage of frequently updated information, unlike hard copies. While both platforms provide similar information, websites require a live internet connection, limiting access to previously downloaded content. On the other hand, mobile apps offer offline access and the flexibility to download desired content, irrespective of a stable internet connection. Yet, they may be limited by small screen size and device memory.



Bridging the socialization gap and group sports.

I'm suspicious of anything that is made compulsory, the same applies to sports or group activities when mandated. I think there is too much emphasis on sports, despite the fact that very few people can make a career out of it. I didn't like how athletes were rewarded with medals for playing sports, making it seem like education was less important. 

However, I enjoyed the recognition of academic excellence in high school, which included cash prizes. I had to do a lot of physical work at home, so I didn't see the need to dedicate so much time to sports. The only activity I wanted to do was martial arts, but there were no options where I lived. Luckily, my children have access to many activities and events through private providers and homeschooling groups. 

We can even start our own group if needed. Homeschooling is about teaching our children to be leaders and creators.

11.1. Interaction with other children.

Many people worry that homeschooling can lead to a lack of interaction with other children, which may affect a child's social skills. However, this has never been a concern for me because I have other children in the house. I understand that if I was homeschooling just one child, this could be an issue. But in our case, my sisters and mother are very social and often take the children to parks, events, and other places where they can meet other kids.

In our area, the Rietvlei Zoo Farm is a great place for socializing and outdoor activities. They have trails, picnic spots, swimming, soccer, and fishing. My house is also frequently visited by my child's friends who come over for visits and sleepovers. In addition, my nephew has more visits from his friends for game nights and going out than I ever did when I was going to school. They even keep in touch online, chatting while playing video games.

So, while some may worry about socialization, there are many ways to address this concern. Living in an extended family has its benefits, especially for the children. They have siblings to keep them company and adults who support them in pursuing their various interests and activities.

Part 4: The not so good and the great.  
Problems thus far.

One of my most vivid memories is my daily school routine during primary school. It included reciting prayers, following rules, and participating in extracurricular activities. This routine continued through my formal education, where there were consequences for not complying. This upbringing prepared me well for my first job in terms of punctuality, respect for authority, and following rules. Despite its imperfections, the formal school system effectively taught routine.

12.1. Enforcing Compliance to schedules at home.
Homeschooling addresses some shortcomings of the formal schooling system, but it also lacks in teaching conformity to routines. There are no fixed schedules or early wake-up times. 

My kids are encouraged to ask questions and think for themselves, even if it goes against what adults do. I don't give grades or busy work, instead I assess their learning progress through projects and subject proficiency. 

While discipline is sometimes excessive in formal schools, routines are important for becoming well-rounded adults. There are various time-sensitive activities at home that promote adherence to schedules. For example, Solo has assigned tasks like feeding the dogs and taking out the garbage. 

Even the youngest children are aware of these routines. However, homeschooling allows for flexibility and there are alternative ways to instil discipline without harsh schedules and military style enforcement.

12.2 Enforcing Discipline.

Parenting can make us vulnerable to our children's emotions. Even as my son grows older, his charm still affects me, making it hard to discipline him. 

This is different with his grandmother and aunts who are not easily swayed. They have more influence and can make him obey. My sisters also have an impact on him. When he doesn't want to go to bed, I call an aunt to convince him. The children in my extended family also help to keep each other in line and avoid trouble. 

This environment has been good for discipline and learning, as we don't need outside authorities. We don't face the risk of harsh punishment because we all care about the child's well-being. Unfortunately, in other cases, nannies or teachers can go too far in disciplining children. But in my household, we have support from other adults, so no one feels overwhelmed and there's always someone to step in if needed.

Benefits to date.

Conquering the fear of deviating from the norm has been my greatest challenge. The rigid structure of formal schooling, followed by the routines of being an employee in the formal sector, had dictated my entire existence. Despite gradually working towards building a life that would enable homeschooling, it would have taken longer to implement without a catalyst.

One key push towards homeschooling came when my family moved into our current home. My nephew and his grandmother moved from the Eastern Cape to Johannesburg and stayed in a property I owned, located just 10 minutes from their current home. Since Ridgeway was closer to Winchester Ridge primary, that was the school he initially attended. Despite my sister's efforts to secure admission in a school within walking distance of our newly consolidated family residence, her attempts were in vain. 

This happened the following year, by which time the COVID lockdowns were on the horizon. I still can't comprehend how someone who doesn't live anywhere near the school can be given preference, especially considering that my property taxes contribute to the school.

The upside of the Draconian COVID lockdowns is that they served as a catalyst, and since then, I have never looked back.

13.1. Cost.

Comparing the fixed costs associated with formal schooling to the online/homeschool option revealed that purchasing the complete package, including online classes and all learning materials, turned out to be cheaper than the cost of transportation alone. Even though the initial cost of setting up a study at home was high, it was lower than the yearly expenses of the most affordable public school in the area for all children.

13.2. Fostering Family Values.

I highly regard my parents, who challenged the education system's beliefs about the ideal family and wealth. Despite not being materially wealthy, their dedication to raising me and my siblings was more valuable than material wealth.

I've seen many people from wealthy families struggle, while my parents' values have been crucial in my life. They taught me hard work, responsibility, and the importance of family, unlike what I learned at school. Thanks to them, I see through deceptive agendas imposed in education.

The formal education system didn't provide me much compared to my parents, and its failures are evident in the high unemployment rate despite more people attending school.

13.3. Healthy Nutrition and Eating Habits.

Improving the ability of children to learn by combatting malnutrition, reducing hunger, and improving school attendance has been a critical aspect of our homeschooling program, ensuring a focus on healthy nutrition and eating habits.

In conclusion, while I am grateful for the success achieved through the formal schooling system, the reality is that I had most of the building blocks needed to make the most of the little education that the school system provided. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the detrimental effects of rolling out a standardized curriculum, and it is clear that the benefits of homeschooling far outweigh the challenges.

13.4. 	Flexible times preventing waking up too early.

Research has shown that it's not good for kids to wake up very early for school. Children aged 3-5 need 13 hours of sleep, 6-12-year-olds need 9-12 hours, and teenagers need 8-10 hours. 

Lack of sleep can lead to health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and strokes. It can also cause obesity and memory issues. Lack of sleep affects learning, behavior, and overall health in kids. Early school start times are associated with greater disciplinary issues and lower test scores in younger students. 

For adolescents, early start times make it difficult for them to get enough sleep and can lead to poorer performance in school. Homeschooling offers more flexibility and allows for more family time. It also benefits parents' sleep schedules, especially in areas with heavy traffic or when the workplace is far from home. 

13.5. Reduced travelling.

In November 2022, an article in the Financial Mail questioned why South Africa has the worst death rates. Between January and March 2023, 2498 lives were lost on South African roads. Many people, including children, are at risk due to the long distances they have to travel to get to work or school.

Many rural schools have closed, leaving children with no formal schooling options close to their homes. The closure of these schools is due to a low number of students as many young people are moving to the cities. As a result, children have to walk longer distances, increasing the risk of accidents.

Additionally, overcrowded and poor-quality public schools in urban areas lead to children using unsafe transport. Incidents of overcrowded and unroadworthy minibus taxis have been reported, exposing children to further risks. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of children being victims of human trafficking and kidnapping.

These risks are a concern for parents, particularly when relying on unsafe transportation for their children. Thankfully any option other than the current rigid school system alleviates this with homeschooling being the best alternative. Not traveling frequently reduces the risk of having a car accident.


Part 5: Informal Knowledge, Unarticulated Wisdom   and Family Diversity   
The danger of equating formal schooling with teaching and qualifications for knowledge.

In my family, my father, with his post matric certificate, obtained valuable employment in rural Transkei, bypassing the need to work in the mines like many others. My mother, without a formal qualification, could be considered uneducated by convetional standards. Despite leaving law school three credits short of my LLB degree, I have achieved more academically than anyone else in my family. I have completed numerous specialized courses, holding a National Diploma and a Bachelor of Technology.

Previously, I prioritized formal, articulated knowledge over informal experience. I believed I needed to achieve a certain career status before having a child in order to provide the best for them. This led me to tirelessly work toward financial stability and access to professional support for my child's growth and development.

14.1. Unarticulated knowledge and uncredentialed expertise.

According to convention my mother's lack of formal qualifications meant she couldn't help my child's health and well-being. 

She would only be loving grandmother with no tanngible contribution. Because both my parents lost their mothers when they were young, I thought I lacked the experience of having a biological grandmother so I worked towards my children have as much access as possible to their biological grandmothers. 

I didn't realize that her best qualification was also the most relevant, raising her own children. My mother has successfully taken care of my nephews and niece, proving that she is still fully capable of playing a crucial role in her grandchildren's development and wellbeing. Despite the material success I achieved, I now understand that the conventional standards of 'the best' don't reflect what's truly important.

14.2. Articulated knowledge and credentialed expertise.

The author's son, Sazi, was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother, the later a retired health professional who has multiple qualifications and a Master's Degree was designated his primary caregiver by his mother. He had access to various medical specialists and specialized care by nannies, which he had at least five nannies by the time he was 5 years. 

Unlike his cousins, who received regular baby food and regular baby products, Sazi's mother only prescribed premium products. He was allowed to visit his paternal home in April 2019, with prepared meals, dietary instructions, and a dedicated nanny. His diet included sugar-free yogurt, grapes, and low-calorie rice cakes. 

Despite all this Sazi spent 5 weeks in the hospital in the first year and continued to be hospitalized at least once a year until he was 3. He was advised to see a speech therapist when he delayed speaking, despite not having any other physical development issues. 

Sazi has seen more doctors and specialists than all other children combined, a credentialed primary caregiver and yet had the worst health outcomes. No other males in the family required speech therapy despite all of us delaying to speak. 

14.3. The value of personal experience over credentialed expertise.

My mistaken belief that formal education and credentials equate to being educated was humbled by a real-life experience. Despite spending more money on Sazi than other children, his outcomes were the worst. 

However, when he started spending more time with his paternal family, his health and well-being improved significantly. His number of doctor visits decreased, and he used fewer antibiotics. He now eats the same food as everyone else in the house and is growing well. His laughter is now as frequent as the other children.

When Sazi had an allergy, spending time with his uneducated grandmother was more effective than expensive interventions from educated specialists. She found a plant in the garden that cured his allergy. 

With the exception of my youngest nephew, every male in my family has delayed to speak, starting with me. Although I had a delayed speech as a child, I had a positive impact on improving the quality of life for my mother, sisters and their children. All of them live well above their means, at my expense affording them a good quality of life and a better environment to raise their children.

The experiences of Dr. Sowell in his book "Late-Talking Children" opened my eyes. Sazi's ability to read without being taught aligned with the patterns of late-talking children described by Dr. Sowell. His research is credible and relatable.
True intelligence is determined by one’s ability to be at least self sufficient, and then go on to provide for loved ones. I have been able to provide for myself since I was 18 with minimal assistance from my mother. My actions have also improved the lives of my mother and my family. The quality of life for all of our family members has improved, and they have a support system for the best and worst of times.

14.4. Physician, heal thyself.

Health professionals often prioritize their own interests over the well-being of their patients. This can lead to negative consequences for individuals and families. 

In contrast, parents and family members have a personal stake in ensuring the best care for their loved ones. Trusting professionals blindly can result in misdiagnosis or ineffective treatments. 

Politicians and bureaucrats also often fail to deliver on their promises. Family members, on the other hand, invest their time and effort in caring for their loved ones. Their dedication often brings greater rewards and fulfillment. Government employees often opt for private services for themselves and their families, which highlights the lack of credibility in their own work. 

Personal experience and first-hand knowledge are more valuable indicators of competence than formal education. It is important to question assertions and seek evidence before accepting them as truth.



Homeschooling complements our diverse family structures.

Conservative South Africans are increasingly supporting the nuclear family as the best way to raise children, even though extended families have been the norm for most of our ancestors. Deteriorating socio economic conditions are forcing some people to return to live with their extended family, despite the current trend of nuclear families. The origin of the nuclear family in South Africa is questionable, particularly for those with rural backgrounds.

15.1. The nuclear family’s sketchy South African origin story.

In the past, young men from the Transkei region left their families to search for work. They often lived in poor conditions to send money home. My grandfathers did this and were able to support their families. Some men started new families while working away. Women often struggled when their husbands did this. Kids were sometimes sent to live with extended family when one or both of the parents die in a nuclear family. When couples face problems, they leave their children with relatives while they worked things out. Extended family is important for support, recognized even by the government.

15.2. The triumph of the extended family.

In 2023, many people are moving back home to live with extended family due to the poor economy. While the number of divorces in South Africa seemed to decrease in 2020, the number of marriages has also been declining. There may not be a direct link between the decline in nuclear families, the drop in marriage rates, and the rise in divorce rates. 

The statistics raise the question of how easily people would stay in a relationship without a legal marriage contract. More than 20% of children in South Africa live with grandparents or other relatives, and extended families are still a common choice for raising children. This might be due to the cost savings and reduced dependence on expensive professionals in an extended family setting.

15.3. The extended family, one of the time-tested solutions to the female headed home crisis.

Female-headed households tend to be poorer compared to other types of households. This is true globally, with the poorest category representing a higher percentage of female-headed households with no male compared to female-headed households with any male or male-headed households. South Asia has the lowest proportion of female-headed households with no male in the wealthiest category. Female-headed households with any male tend to be wealthier than those without any male in all regions, except for Eastern & Southern Africa and Middle East & North Africa, where the distribution of wealth is similar between female-headed households with any male and male-headed households. 

Children in female-headed households face disadvantages, especially when there is no adult male present. The presence of a male figure, whether it's a father or uncle, has a significant impact on the well-being of the household. Extended family settings provide more support and stability for children compared to nuclear families or single-parent households. 

Children share similarities with their kin, even if they are adopted and raised apart from their biological relatives. Extended family members play a crucial role in shaping a child's identity and providing important support. The extended family environment acts as a control and reduces the likelihood of mistreatment or neglect of children. 

In times of difficulty, the familiar support of extended family can help parents in dealing with challenges. Being raised in an extended family setting offers more options and support for a child compared to being far away from supportive relatives. Relying on government services as the primary support can often be worse than being raised in a female-headed household.

15.4. The nuclear and female-headed household model reliance on external surrogates.

Newsweek reported evidence in 1989 that putting infants in daycare for 20 or more hours a week can be risky due to high turnover among caregivers and high disease rates. However, discussing these problems publicly was seen as a concern, as some feared it could be used to argue that only mothers can care for babies. 

Some believed that a traditional family is still the best way to raise children and mothers are needed at home. Relying on specialists and external parties to care for children, as seen in the nuclear family setup, is seen as a downside. 

This dependence on external care is nothing new, and the extended family has thrived throughout history despite modern alternatives. Conservatives have long warned against relying on external surrogates to raise children. There's no harm in prioritizing women and having the father and extended family care for children at home while the woman pursues her career.

15.5. Homeschooling is flexible as families are diverse.

It is important to minimize the negative impact of parental separation on a child's relationship with both parents and extended family. More children are being born into these circumstances due to the high prevalence of divorces, declining marriage rates, and individuals choosing to have children without being in a relationship.

In the past, my parents had clear roles in their relationship. My mother stayed at home while my father worked to provide for the family. They worked well together because they had different skills and qualities for raising children.

When my son's parents met, we were already independent individuals. We didn't rely on each other for practical tasks like cooking and cleaning. Our only reliance was on romantic love. However, romantic love alone is seldom enough, if ever, to sustain a relationship.

Enrolling a child in a fixed school can limit their time with the other parent, especially when parents are not together. Remote learning and homeschooling provide better options for children in these situations.

Homeschooling allows for flexibility and the opportunity for children to learn from family members. It also allows fathers to spend more time with their children, as they may have more flexible schedules than mothers in the day of racial and gender quatas in the workplace. Fathers play an important role in preparing children for life's challenges.

Sports and physical activity can be beneficial for men as outlets. However, school sports have become less competitive and focus more on safety, which may not be beneficial for boys and men. Mothers often prioritize protection over preparing their children.

Extended families are more honest and hold each other accountable. It is important for both parents to be honest with each other to ensure the well-being of their child. Honesty helps shape the family's reality and allows for better planning.

It is important to hold my son's mother accountable and be honest with her. I admire her experience as an only child, as my son is also an only child. I feel a great responsibility to ensure that my son has access to real-life experiences and kinship.

Overall, it is important to minimize the negative impact of parental separation and prioritize the well-being of the child.
Part 6: In closing, at least for now 
Homeschooling makes sense, even for non homeschoolers and government.   

In October 2023, South Africans had a lot to celebrate. Despite the rugby win, the most notable cause for celebration was the uninterrupted power supply from Eskom, which were a pleasant change from the frequent power outages. 

Traffic flow also improved due to functioning traffic lights and streetlights. Additionally, people experienced more confidence that shops and services will run predictable aas they should. It has become a norm for places to suddenly close because of loadshedding, leaving customers stranded. Food spoilage was also less of a concern due to a reduction in power outages. 

Could the improvements have been caused by the president’s appointment of an electricity minister? 

Not even close!

16.1. The case against centralisation, electricity supply as an example
Private individuals in South Africa have been taking action to decrease their reliance on the electricity grid and turn to alternative energy sources. Data shows that households and businesses have installed a significant amount of rooftop solar PV. 

This shift in energy sources is a response to frequent power cuts experienced in the country. The government's approach to electricity supply, with Eskom as a monopoly, has been a problem in meeting the increasing demand. However, private individuals investing in solar power have been able to provide electricity for themselves and others. 

This would have been the ideal solution in reducing the costs of rolling out electricity in rural areas where homes are spread apart and alternative energy sources like firewood and cow dung are commonly used. The government's policies and failure to address the needs of rural residents have contributed to poverty in rural areas and the subsequnt migration towards urban areas. 

Installing solar panels has become popular as it improves property value, but this is not possible in tribal land without proper property rights. The current relief from power cuts is not due to government efforts, but rather the actions of private individuals. Their investments benefit both themselves and those who cannot afford alternative energy sources.

16.2. The case for homeschooling, for everyone's benefit.

The formal schooling system hasn't delivered on its promises despite receiving more funding. 

Offering different education options chosen by parents could reduce pressure on the formal school system. This could lead to better education conditions for those who stay in formal schools. Overcrowded classes have led to increased negative impacts on children. Urban migration and limited investment in rural areas force children to travel long distances to school, putting their lives at risk. 

The formal schooling system limits creativity and critical thinking for everyone. Informal schooling has benefits and should be considered to alleviate the burden on children and families. This approach would allow parents to spend more time with their children, and those who prefer formal schooling could have better conditions for learning.
