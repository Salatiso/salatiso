Chapter 11
“Some things are believed because they are demonstrably true, but many other things are believed simply because they have been asserted repeatedly.” Thomas Sowell. The insistence to continue with the application of the maternal rule, contrary to both the best interests of the child and the equality clause of the Constitution implies there must be justification beyond the law amongst its proponents. If mothers deserve this preference, contrary to the provisions of the law then surely there must be evidence to justify this approach. All children have basic needs, which means any bias towards mothers implies that they are often, if not always the ones that can meet those basic needs of the child. The implication is that because mothers have historically been the ones with a primary role of rearing children, they pass these to their offspring daughters to the detriment of their sons. 

I can remember not so long ago this being used as the argument to discriminate against women in the workplace. Somehow those that hadn’t kept up with the benefits brought about by innovation and moving towards service economies hadn’t seen that very few jobs demanded the natural attributes that once could have justified his preference. Once the legal barriers were removed, individual rights to choose when to have a child at least asserted and innovation through birth control enabled such rights to be realised limitations in pursuing a corporate career by women were further eroded. As it continues to be proven today and generations to come women are just as capable pursuing any career they choose, just because men previously had more opportunities didn’t imply all men were as adept, or willing at the roles their fathers performed. The prevalence of men in the workplace faded as proof of men being more adept at being providers, as such even before the law it could not be justified to exclude women from the workplace. 

The continued application of this rule is a self fulfilling fallacy. The same technological innovations that have broken the barriers in the workplace for women have inadvertently freed the men from its shackles. Being restricted to an assigned role has proven impossible for us humans, even the lack of wings that evolution endowed on birds to enable their flight hasn’t restricted us humans from soaring beyond even the bird’s reach. No matter the pride I have for my father, somehow I know the path he had chosen in his life would have, one way or another killed him. The thought of being bred for maximum profit somehow is more reminiscent of machines in an assembly line than it is of humans, yet despite the moral justification we might assign and social rewards we endow the men of yore they were bred for maximum profit with disposable lives. Heroes might have been motivated to kill to attain their status, but often the same sword they lived by was eventually their demise. They might have braved the elements in pursuit of that wild animal for dinner, just before nature relaliated or the animal turned out to be the one pursuing them. Either way, I only imagine a Hobbesian reality for these men, my father included. One I am grateful they lived so that I wouldn’t, and neither will any of their descendents unless they so choose, a commitment I made to express my gratitude. 

Despite any emotional feelings we might have ultimately parenting is as much a skill as is any job. Any advantages nature endowed women for bringing the child to life quickly fade with each day such a child is born, as will eventually the relevance of both parents once the child matures into an adult. If this wasn’t the case there would be no justification for millions of women to leave their newborns under the care of another, days after birth to fulfill their employment obligations. Adoption at birth would be a crime if a child was so tethered to their mothers that they wouldn’t survive being separated. Only the worst fate would befall any child whose mother didn’t survive the birth process. None of these are the case however despite any fuzzy feelings we might have. 

Millions of children's lives have been saved because their mothers could go back to work as soon as possible so that they can afford to provide for their needs. Millions more have found new parents, with sex not being a factors between the adopting parents and most children who’s birth mothers unfortunately die at birth continue to grow into adulthood. The only differentiator between the chances of any child to grow into adulthood has been the ability to provide for the child’s needs. For the longest time the only indicator that these needs could be efficiently provided for was a union between the parents so as to maximise the benefits towards their offspring. Any weakness they had in their individual capacity was hopefully nullified by the union. 

Now however, everyone has equal opportunities to earn an income and provide for their child. This means both sexes now enjoy the same opportunities and can choose how much they want to earn and when they would like to have a child. The void that is left at home because the mother now has to go to work can be filled by the father who most likely is unemployed. A consequence of positive discrimination to redress the historical inequalities in the workplace. The drive to ensure equality of outcome in the workplace means that employers are incentivised to employ a female candidate should the parents go and compete for the same job. At best if the two are evenly matched on merit there are tangible benefits to the employer for such an approach because even with legal compliance not being a factor a positive Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment score could be the only difference between retaining or losing that government tender. So even at best the father’s ability to provide is limited by his gender. At worst he probably has a criminal record, a curse he acquired most likely in pursuit of conforming to societal pressure and having only peers to teach him. It’s not as if he had his father to at least learn from because he probably was not there.

 The same duties that would have been fulfilled by a professional nanny can be done by the father alleviating financial pressure while maximising the time between parent and child. Having been a child I made me content, based on the ability of my parents to meet their obligations. Being the first born exposed me to opportunities to look after my siblings so I learned the skills. Any of these competencies I still lack I have support, family and professional. 

I know however that these competencies surely cannot include an ability to provide because if that were the case then I’d have been wronged to be deprived of an equal opportunity to be a parent. Just like my son’s mother I too have an income to provide for my child. If it is a home a child needs I have that too. I even have a car, just like she does if that is one of the parameters. I have acquired all these which I thought to be necessities for him to live a better life than I did. As a student I was diligent, an attitude I carried with my employers thus I have been able to build a life for my son. Despite the temptation and seemingly trend I have earned my income thus accumulated assets legally, because I knew a criminal record might be enough to discount me as a parent.

I have spent my life studying so that I can learn what I don’t know and have accumulated experience to prepare me for the task ahead. Where I fall short I have a family who are there to makeup for my shortcomings. If experience counts for anything one of them raised the man who fathered that child. She continues to play an active role in her descendents, my nephews and niece who mothers are just as competent as any mother at worst, not that they are even close to that. I know it is not because I cannot prove any of these because Buggz mother has lived my life. If public records are the only proof that will suffice a deed search will reveal my liabilities and assets, tax records with Google ever so ready to reveal anything else that might prove my worth.

While I may be aware of the law to side with the previously disadvantaged public evidence will prove we are on equal footing, by most tangible measures at least. Our son is a product of mutual consent between parties beyond the age of consent, with full capacity to contract at the time and did so out of free choice. If age counts for anything we are evenly matches so even at face value we are equals. We have grown up in the same country if it is geography that justifies the discriminination, any risks or opportunities we were exposed to were at least the same with any prior socio statuses being of neither’s contribution. 

My mother and father had a contract that they both consented to knowing both the risks and benefits ahead. At best my father did not have the time to earn an income and provide for his family if it required him to also rear us full time as well. Neither did my mother have the competencies and resources to earn an income while attending to her family to her full abilities. They ultimately chose their paths, they consented to tradition. In choosing the path however they knew the implications and thus potential consequences, my mother would end up raising 4 children alone because my father drank himself to death. 

Whether it was foresight in my father for me not to meet a similar demise or aspiration from my mother’s missed opportunity at independence they both ensured I would not meet their fate. I can earn an income to provide for my son just like my father did for me but at the same time I can attend to all his needs, whether directly or through my family. Neither has my son’s mother ever had any assertions I see her as having to forgo her’s at my career’s benefit. She has never lost any opportunities to ascend to any heights she might aspire to in order to make as much income as she wishes. This is outside of my control. I neither lost nor benefit from it. 

Which legal provision or norm justifies me having to bear most of the obligations while deriving the least time with my son? Am I only a parent as far as my money is concerned? This cannot be the case, at least in relation to my son because I know it was not the case with me. When I lost my father his financial contributions merely stagnated and reduced but they never diminished, it was his absence from my life that caused the most impact. My mother, the great woman she is would never be as great as she was despite the effort. Maybe I look after my sister because I feel guilty that I at least had the most time not only with him but with her and her best as well, when all she needed to worry about was her part because my father did his. If it counts for anything their weaknesses have never been mine.

 
BACKGROUND

South Africa is a country of contrasts and disparities, this couldn't be more obvious even if you are an international visitor. From the time you land in one of our world class airports which offer facilities and services that can be compared to the best in the world, whether you hail from a first world country looking to explore or from one that has lesser opportunities you will feel like you are home or where your dreams can be fulfilled. By the time you leave that world class facility enroute to your 5 star hotel the sight of squatter camps which reflect the other side of the coin which is poverty you start to experience this disparity.

The disparities continue to be apparent when you switch on your news source and converse with the locals. Assuming you came to the country to invest, whether as a tourist who wants to spend their currency in exchange for a relaxing and exhilarating vacation or a business person you quickly get the conflicting message. The brutal scenes from xenophobic attacks that have escalated to a point that some countries opted to evacuate their citizens are likely to paint a contradictory message to the one you heard of us, whether as a country or continent to come and invest. You probably came here on our invite to plough your hard earned money yet when you are here, there's a chance that you could be mugged or even killed before you head back home. The well prepared speeches from our politicians that convinced you to come quickly become moot when you see the hostility we have displayed to non-South Africans. These however are just highlights of the daily realities many South Africans face, irrespective of race, gender, sex, culture etc

To an outsider and ourselves we say we respect human rights but while you are enjoying the cultural exhibitions as you sip your mqombothi in your resort an examination of this culture reveals a concerning picture. In 2017 stats SA reports that close to hundred thousand minors were married off in exchange for lobolla by their parents? There's no mid-year or end of the year school break that doesn't start with teenage men dying in circumcision schools, again practiced by consent of every South African but consistently leads to unnecessary deaths, in the name of culture.

The promulgation of the Constitution should have paved the road to equality but to date we continue to be amongst the most unequal societies. The misguided pursuit of redress has led us to continue with exactly the same policies our freedom came as a reaction to, except of course now instead of apartheid we use affirmative action and black economic empowerment to justify segregation. The only difference being that at least now the tables have turned and it is the natives that are supposed to be benefiting, the reality however doesn't change from the fact that it's segregation on the bases of skin colour in an era where we are supposed to be equal.

This, of course has had negative consequences because instead of building one country because of the insistence to enforce these dividing policies we have alienated some of the country's citizens we ought to be working with towards mutual success. It's not as if the policies worked either to further the cause of most natives which were supposed to be beneficiaries because more than anything it's the politicians that are living in luxury while masses are suffering.

For the past 37 years of my life I've lived through the effects of this lie but it wasn't until my son was conceived that I had the opportunity to do something about it, or at least a part of it because as problems go we have them in endless supply in Africa. Until 1994 the prevailing approach as confirmed by judgements and societal beliefs the role of men and women both at home and in the workplace was unequal. Consistent with practices from time immemorial men were the designated providers while women were the nurturers. At some point this was justifiable both logically and through natural law but industrialization that automated most of the work eliminating the physical requirements which favoured men at work started to fade. This was further confirmed by the Constitution which is the highest law in the country that confirmed unjustified discrimination in the workplace on the bases of gender is illegal. Consistent with the rest of the world we embraced this approach and to date the fight to eliminate bias in the workplace has never lost momentum.

From as young as I can remember I've never earned any unfair advantage on the bases of my gender as a man, in fact I doubt anyone dares to even make this allegation because the mere mention of it not only leads to public condemnation but legal consequences as well. As an individual who has reported to both male and female superiors I can attest my support for this because to date it has never been gender that separated who I considered to be my best managers but competence.

I had long suspected however that one of the reasons we are where we are with the almost eroded moral fibre was the inconsistent application of these principles. The Constitution meant for equality between genders but to date, not only as a country but even the first world states we still don’t apply this at home. This belief of men being providers despite women having equal opportunities still prevails. So much so that even with equal salaries, notions of men being providers and women nature's still prevail. This of course has had disastrous consequences especially for the women because daily I read a study that claims how women can't get as far as men in the workplace because of their domestic obligations. Impossible to comprehend in a country that claims everyone is equal that people were still suffering from something that we said we solved with our highest law! 

CHAPTER 1: Motivation

Having grown up in a country that is plagued by poverty I've always had an interest in the socio economic aspects, more so because I also had to start my life at the bottom end of the economic scale. I was born in Eastern Cape, one of the most rural and poor provinces in South Africa. Ironically however there is a mismatch in terms of the birth rate when viewed against the parent’s means to support the children. This trend is not that much different for the rest of the country and the continent at large for that matter, which probably explains the third world conditions that prevail throughout. This means despite the lack of resources conducive for a child's development these children are born into these conditions that culminate in an endless cycle of poverty. Strangely enough however there is more justification for this behaviour whether through tradition or religion, kids are after all a blessing. Yes having them while one barely lacks the means to support themselves is a lifetime curse to the child, cast by those that should have had a duty to protect the children, the parents!

I was one of the many African children who were born into these circumstances, and if to reinforce a tradition the death of my father at 11 thrust me into adulthood sooner than I believed fair to any child. The death of my father brought forth the glaring reality of how unprepared my parents were for the task they chose to undertake of having 4 children. A then normal and acceptable family with a father who was the provider and a mother who was a housewife, as had been the case before for so many other children in my place, proved so inefficient the impact we'd have to carry as the descendants. At first I watched helpless as my mother had to now learn to fulfil the dual role in the absence of my father. A task so strenuous it would almost be the end of her. 

The irony is that I was still better off than most because at least I had a father at one point, whom despite the shortfall did endeavour to provide so much so that there would be some plan even beyond his life. A situation where at least the parents were married was the norm when I grew up, even though their ability to have children was never matched to their ability to provide for them at least at with both of them there the task would be shared. As I grew up, however the reality of children being born by parents who were not married would only be surpassed by the scourge of HIV that did even more to worsen the problem. By 2018 households ran by single mothers would rocket to #####$$ according to Stats SA's report on Socio Economic Factors. As I grew however I'd learn with dismay that rather than society discouraging children being born without considering one’s ability to provide for them was not discouraged, rather the opposite. 

My mother had done well in raising us so as soon as I could, I saw no other alternative but to help her with my siblings. It was not so much out of my love for her and my siblings as it was logic that I felt no other alternative but to succeed my father. Just as it would have been the case if the circumstances were more favourable I felt it necessary to inherit his debt and lead the family as a first born was said to have had to. To date I still can't remember whether it was my parents subliminal programing since they never imposed any pressure or my culture which reinforced the duty that comes with being a first born male. According to tradition, and the Bible as I would learn through my early Christian exposure it was obligatory for the children to take care of their family out of moral obligation. The disconnect however I'd see was that there was the subjectivity of the arrangement, according to norm as progressed by both, by virtue of being family one always had an obligation to provide to their blood. The flaw in this requirement as I would soon learn and rebel, was that it didn't take into consideration merit. So the notion of children being a blessing thus having more was God's will would be abused by parents who had children as insurance, so that the children could provide for the parents. The blood ties by extension included the siblings and the extended family at large with the expectation being clear that since you can you will for all of us, whether we add any value to your life is immaterial. 

So already a I had an obligation before I knew how to create one. I'd have to start my life, as is the case with most by having to honour such obligations I did not create in pursuit of appeasing my ancestors and subsequently God. Unlike most however I'd question this approach at the risk of being smited by God by opting to contract with my family on measurable inputs and outputs towards a common objective. Sadly however so many to date continue to follow in the footsteps of those who have failed on the back of their ancestors misinterpreted message, the cycle continues.

My experience would be the bases of what not to do for my child. The anger within would spark the quest to ensure that no more will any of my parents descendants have to go through what I had to! The achiever my parents had raised me to be would not be content in only changing this narrative for his own descendants but the obligation would extend upstream. It would be the quest to change my family's future that would lead me to query everyone's as well, it is not as if after all my family exists in a vacuum. It was through my grandfather I learnt kindness, my uncle I was reminded of what my father taught me of manhood and my country I was enabled to free them from the shackles of poverty. My sense of duty would extend far beyond my immediate because in freeing my son it was through the intervention of every tax payer in my country. The skills I'd learn to build my value would be the contribution of the whole world through using the tools most of which were developed in other countries, so how then would it be justified my interest would only be limited to my family?

My quest led me to an early conclusion of traditional norms and practices as the primary contributors to the problem. The interpretation of our culture has after all been reduced to mean we must apply expired solutions to today's problems and bleed ourselves dry of resources we barely have enough of, all in the name of appease the dead. Supposedly the dead have unparalleled power over the living and failure to accede to their needs could bring about contempt, so the fairly tale goes. I’d be lying if I said there is no evidence of the impact of this dedication to the dead, there is tons of it throughout the country and continent. The problem however is that such evidence rather than affirm the value of the practice through positive outcomes it is the opposite, compare Africa to anywhere where they are more future orientated rather than focused on the past and the results speak for themselves. Society continues to encourage practices that reinforce the native child as the one who must first start backwards before he can move ahead. By the time he is ready to start his own future he is so tired she can't help but repeat the same cycle. 

In 1982 when I was born so much was different in South Africa mostly due to the political environment. By the time however I was old enough to start formulating my own opinions the country was being swept to a then new democratic dispensation that would be the basis of my thinking. Much closer to home the years close to the political emancipation would also inform the direction my future would take much more prominently than in any other period in my life.

It would be the hardships I would go through as a child that would lay the principles for what I now believe is the blueprint for my family's emancipation from the shackles of poverty. When my father died I was 11, he was the sole breadwinner at the time with my mother attending to us amongst her other domestic duties. The void his death left was so big I believe it marked a turning point for my family. Despite the weight of the task I opted to continue to support my family, as he would have as soon as I could. 

The concept of an heir as an African was unfamiliar to me. When the head of the household met their demise their assets did not devolve amongst those he chose or chosen by the law. In fact the concept of individual ownership which would result in personal assets was foreign. Instead, the first born male would continue in the footsteps of their father and forefathers by taking control of the family assets for the benefit of the family. So if the family had attained wealth the successor would take control of the assets and continue the tradition for the benefit of the family, with the support of the family through consultation. So in cases of prominence and wealth the successor would be in charge of a thriving family fortune, at face value at least because experience will show you that leading, whether a success story or failure is a burden only few have been able to bear. Inversely however this meant the same male child had to carry the same obligations even if the demise of his predecessor came when the family fortunes were at a negative.

When the demise of my father came, although had been on a continual incline all the years since my birth, hadn't reached a point where it could self-sustain. The family had grown to 4 children which meant more mouths to feed, an obligation that could be met as long as my father was willing to sacrifice parenting time in pursuit of employment income. A ‘perfect’ system when all is working well but life seldom does. His absence from the equation however would upset this balance. My mother, the strong woman she is would endeavour to plug the gaping hole through obtaining employment but for someone who's never had this obligation to suddenly have to carry the burden alone in their 30's with minimal resources and education, this was bound to be a tumultuous task. It also didn't help that she had 4 children to raise, all while managing the dynamics and family expectations as had been informed by tradition. For one who's always had the support of another, the task is daunting enough but add children the task is almost impossible. Amongst the children however was me, a boy whom despite the support of a relentless mother the role of a father to guide my future was still irreplaceable. 

But yet I chose to follow the methods of yore. It was not out of benevolence as introspection would show but logic. My mother had delivered on her joint parental obligation with my father. Likewise despite the shortcomings I could not crucify him for what what I thought at the time he failed to anticipate, his own demise. Even if I could however it would do more harm than good because he was dead, no matter how much he messed up he couldn’t come back to clean it up, fortunately he had me. My mother would continue to raise a man and 3 women on her own, through the support of family most notably my uncle who shaped my concept of a father figure to me. He never had to but still chose to be there, and while some of his motivation was through inspiration most of it came from his warnings, often taught the hard way of ‘what not to do’. 

So I chose. I chose to embrace what would appear at face value would be my life's enemy. I embraced the traditional way of doing things instead of focusing only on my own life and family I would choose to have in whatever form. I took on my father's obligations to support my mother deliver on their obligation as parents as would have been the case if he had lived.  I committed, as he had to, to undertake the obligation until at least all my siblings would be grown enough to stand on their own. 

From a potential burden to society I've had to carry my family from when the little we had was hardly enough to survive. let alone thrive. In less than 40 years the lives of all who descended from my mother and father, is now one of choice rather than bare necessity. While yesterday the biggest worry was where we were going to get what we need to get us by now we can plan for tomorrow because today is under control. My debt to those who gave support, in whatever way they could have been repaid in more than kind. I committed to repay those that supported us when he wasn’t there to and I did, and continue to do so. When they gave for my and sibling’s benefit I took it as an investment into our future and as such paid it forward when I couldn’t pay it directly. The process of getting to access to tertiary education was facilitated by accommodation I was offered when my mother asked, I repaid that in more than kind. When I asked for finance to pursue my education my country responded with a loan I've been forever grateful for, I repaid it in full. Then some over and over as I do today through my tax and sharing what I learn.

There was a time I was angry because I thought the burden was too heavy for one like myself at the time was so young. Like so many I grappled with the option of letting go of the obligation but I could not rationalise attaining success as an individual knowing I could have brought my family along. After all, if it was wealth my father had left would I still have been as angry and eager to leave them to fend for themselves? In retrospect the prospect of doubting myself is amongst the biggest insult I've ever extended to my father, if not the only. It would take my mother to prepare me for the task ahead which she would also benefit from. My most selfless act would be my most selfish, as it was to begin with. 

It was the impossibility of the task that made me take it on to begin with because the rewards far outweighed the risks. My failure would only have faded as one of many but my success would potentially change the course of all those who descend from my parents. The loss of a father would not symbolise loss of support because in my mother he had chosen the best woman most prepared for the task ahead. I'd use the anger and vigour of my youth to fuel my family's rise. 

The rise of my family always meant my own personal rise. I could not leave my father's obligations unattended no matter how heavy the load seemed because as has been my experience in the gym, the bigger the weight the bigger the strength and muscle. Maybe it was this vanity to realise my own success that pushed me to bring others along. The size of my muscle and strength were the symbol I could finally stand for myself. So I carried my family until they could run alongside me in our pursuit of economic freedom. Freedom from poverty. I carried them until they could inspire me, to make my star shine brighter than ever. And when it did they were there to carry me when I couldn't. When the pursuit of what ought to have been logical it was Mila's smile that would remind me to work harder toward a better tomorrow, her better tomorrow which would be everyone's better tomorrow.

Along the way however I needed inspiration far beyond my anger so I looked beyond my own. Beyond my family there was my community who shared the same shackles of poverty so I looked further in my country. There were not enough lessons of success so I looked at failure to inspire me what not to do. I yearned for positives but I was surrounded by failure so I took caution instead. While the subtle hum of success could be heard from afar the eardrum bursting noise from failure was overwhelming. The values and discipline that had been instilled by my parents provided for a solid foundation so I could stand my ground and silence the noise.  The caution would allow me the wisdom to avoid the same blunders as had been repeated by so many. The path would lead me to leave up to my purpose.

The biggest take was what not to do. What not to do for my family to remain in the clasps of poverty. What not to emulate from my mates to end up a failure to launch. What not to repeat from my ancestors that relegated us to mediocrity while success was always there for those who were willing to work for it. I learnt from what my parents had done wrong to end up where they were so that I wouldn't when I had my child. The positive lessons they taught me and discipline they entrenched motivated me to succeed when failure was an option. I had to rise beyond the rhetoric to free my family. I thought the fight was over with democratic South Africa but the fight had taken a different form, the country had attained its freedom but individual persons and families though their communities had to free themselves to realise it. As had always been, the enemy out there was the easier to defeat even though success would only be attained when the enemy within was destroyed. The lessons had always been there but so many before failed to heed the call in fear of condemnation. Compliance to convention always guaranteed acceptance but did little to offer justice and fulfilment, some of our greatest virtues as humans.

From the lessons I swore never to repeat what I had gone through even though it did come with its own lessons. The subjective duties purported as moral virtues revealed the primary reason why my people had, for so long, failed to account for their contribution, in pursuit of an intangible. I saw my methods succeed because in serving my primal needs through others I got more. The drive to never fail saw me surpass what I thought to be my limits. With each minute, day, year and decade I’ve lived my family got better so I chose to do more. What would have sufficed was no longer enough so I pushed further. Leaning on those that chose to lean on me, living in a country that inspired me to be better because it reinforced my equality.

Equality before the law to every person in the country. No matter their financial status, race, age or gender. Equal to every other human in unison towards a common goal.

Through that inspiration, at the back of my motivation I shaped the future of my descendants. A future that could not be exclusive of those of all my father and mothers descendants because I had chosen to succeed. But an obligation that extended beyond my own family, to my country and the world as a family, because the successful execution of my duty depends on my kids coming to a world that's worth living in. A world where not just mine is taken care of even if through my strife but the whole. My son will still need to live with others. When Solo needs a stage to pursue his engineering solution they will need to solve someone's problem, beyond the family home to bring about his prosperity. If Milande chooses to expand his energy through performance arts he will need an audience to perform to. Mila could aspire to inspire and teach from the lessons her parents will teach, she still needs one to inspire. One of the world. My world. A world who's success I have a vested interest in because it speaks to the success of those I value the most. My family. My country. My world.

My personal journey drove me to be interested in others. I swore never to let any descendant of mine ever have to deal with what I had to, but with that came the obligation to offer my solutions the world over. I set off to find out, through implementing what I thought was just towards my children, the reasons why so many walk the path of strife before they are competent to. So many children grow up quicker than they should to augment their parent’s failures at worst, oversights at best towards ensuring the family success. A success whose failure impacts all of us, the country wide and the world over. When a child is failed by her parents she still needs to live in the country while navigating the world. We may see an irresponsible adult but he has a childhood that set him up for that adulthood. That girl you condemn for being the slut was once a child who needed to be taught by her parents. 
CHAPTER 2: Placeholder
Having grown up in a third world country I've always had an interest in the socio economic aspects, more so because I also had to start my life at the bottom end of the economic scale. I was born in Eastern Cape, a mostly rural province in South Africa. Even to date the province is still one of the poorest in the country with stats SA reporting unemployment figures of ######## in 2017. Ironically however the province also has one of the highest birth rates in the country. This trend is no different for the rest of the country and the continent at large for that matter. This means despite the lack of resources conducive for a child's development these children are born into these conditions that culminate to an endless cycle.

I was one of the many African children who were born into these circumstances, and if to reinforce a tradition the death of my father at 11 thrust me into adulthood sooner than I believed fair to any child. The death of my father brought forth the glaring reality of how unprepared my parents were for the fast they undertook of having 4 children. A then normal and acceptable family of a father who was the provider and a mother who solely attended to us and the home would, as had been the case before for so many other children in my place, prove so inefficient the impact we'd have to carry as the descendants. At first I watched helpless as my mother had to now learn to fulfil the dual role in the absence of my father. A task that would prove so strenuous it would almost be the end of her. 

The irony is that I was still better off than most because at least I had a father at one point, whom despite the shortfall did endeavour to provide so much so that there would be some plan even beyond his life. A situation where at least the parents were married was the norm, even though their ability to have children was not proportional to their ability to provide for them at least at one point they were both there. As I grew up however the reality of children being born by parents who were not married would only be surpassed by the scourge of HIV that did even more to worsen the problem. By 2018 households ran by single mothers would rocket to #####$$ according to Stats SA's report on Socio Economic Factors. As I would grow however I'd learn with dismay that rather than society discouraging children being born without considering one's ability to provide for them was not discouraged, rather the opposite. 

My mother had done well in raising us so as soon as I could I saw no other alternative but to help her with my siblings and herself. It was not so much out of my emotional love for her and my siblings as it was logic that I felt no other alternative but to succeed my father. Just as it would have been the case if the circumstances were more favourable I felt it necessary to inherit his debt and lead the family as a first born was said to have had to. To date I still can't remember whether it was my parents subliminal programing since they never imposed any pressure or my culture which reinforced the duty that comes with being a first born male. According to tradition, and the Bible as I would learn through my early Christian exposure it was obligatory for the children to take care of their family out of moral obligation. The disconnect however I'd see was that there was the subjectivity of the arrangement, according to norm as progressed by both, by virtue of being family one always had an obligation to provide to their blood. The flaw in this requirement as I would soon learn and rebel, was that it didn't take into consideration merit. So the notion of children being a blessing thus having more was God's will would be abused by parents who had children as insurance, so that they could (children) provide for them should they fail in having a prosperous life. The blood ties by extension included the siblings and the extended family at large with the expectation being clear that since you can you will for all of us, whether we add any value to your life is immaterial. 

So already as a black African child I had an obligation before they knew how to create one. I'd have to start my life, as is the case with most by having to honour obligations I did not create in pursuit of appeasing my ancestors and subsequently God. Unlike most however I'd question this approach at the risk of being smited by God by opting to contract with my family on measurable inputs and outputs towards a common objective. Sadly however so many to date continue to follow in the footsteps of those who have failed on the back of their ancestors misinterpreted message, the cycle continues.

My experience would be the bases of what not to do for my child. The anger within would spark the quest to ensure that no more will any of my parents descendants have to go through what I had to! The overachiever my parents had raised me to be would not be content in only changing this narrative for his own descendants but the obligation would extend uphill. It would be the quest to change my family's future that would lead me to query everyone's as well, it is not as if after all my family exists at a vacuum. It was through my grandfather I learnt kindness, my uncle I was reminded of what my father taught me of manhood and my country I was enabled to free them from the shackles of poverty. My sense of duty would extend far beyond my immediate because in freeing my son it was through the intervention of every tax payer in my country. The skills I'd learn to build my value would be the contribution of the whole world, so how then would it be justified my interest would only be limited to my family?

My quest led me to an early conclusion of traditional norms and practices as the primary contributors to the problem. It was after all in honour of pursuing our afterlife through the blessing of our ancestors that we continue to bleed ourselves dry with no objective measurements. Society continues to encourage that reinforce the black child as the one who must first start backwards before he can move ahead. By the time she is ready to start her own future she is so tired she can't help but reinforce the norm downstream. Meanwhile, through vague, outdated and often misrepresented interpretation of culture and religion to those who won't question, the practice the has slowed the progress of the African child so much sometimes we mistake it for regression.

Meanwhile in the West their child continues to define our future. Despite your emotional and sentimental attachment to the ways of your everything that is relevant to your life is no product of your own. The East, in cases of those that were once where were are is catching up if not done already, so once again your reality is still not a product of your own. The house you live in was engineered from the West and is powers by technology from the East all the while cruising in your Japanese SUV. This is my reality. The curiosity to query the reason behind and the factors that contribute to Africa lagging behind through its children was always bound to have me asking the questions.

I can however not discount the power of negative reinforcement because through not knowing what not to do, as proven by most of my people today I at least had an advantage. By opting to tread the path less travelled, often at loggerheads with the sense of what ought to define me, I am prevailing. My family is prevailing. My country as must the world must also prevail.

The experience I went through of losing my father and having to help my mother to a point of leadership inspired this journey. My baby will be a baby when he is one, because I expect nothing less of an adult when the time comes. This meant I had to define the stereotype and buck the trend.


Chapter 11: The p plan
From the onset I tried to keep the relationship as clinical and focused as possible. Admittedly I was also relieved that there was no emotional attachment between the two of us and our only objective would be Buggz. If our duty towards each other is to keep each other accountable, having feelings could compromise that and the person who would suffer the most is Buggz. As parents neither of us know the best way to parent, we each have our views based on our cumulative experiences and resources. Unless the parenting process is done objectively there is a risk the child might be biased towards the emotionally dominant parent. The emotionally compromised parent might not object against something that will harm the child in the future because it is proposed by the other parent whom they don’t wish to ‘hurt’. 

A formal parenting plan offered the most plausible solution to this problem. Fortunately it is also legislated so having one is not only the logical thing to do but also legal. The law also prescribes the principles upon which this plan should be based through different provisions it contains including;
Putting the child’s interests first. Quote the children’s Act, then Constitution, then United Nations.
With regards to the parents equality is prescribed as follows;
Children’s Act - Equal Rights and Obligations,
Constitution - Equality Clause,
United Nations - Equality Clause
The law is also explicit on how the rights and obligations should be apportioned between the parents with equality being the prevailing principle. 

The law also advocates for a non adversarial relationship between the parents, a reasonable approach considering it is in both parent’s interests to work together as a successful relationship benefits  their greatest interest, the child. This is evident in the structure of the law as it does not favour anyone on the bases of their sex. Furthermore it has set up structures in the Family Advocate as an intermediary before getting to an adversarial court process. Even when it does get to court, the family court is structured differently from other courts. Describe family court with a direct quote from the judiciary or case.

The non adversarial approach is nothing new, it is inherent in our society down to the family structure. While conflict is part of the growth process due to fluctuating hormones throughout a person’s life-cycle, childbearing may itself often be a privilege of these young ‘feisty’ adults ready bump heads, often however the grandparents are still alive and involved. Even the most hot headed young adult will often be tamed by age. This perhaps is the reason why even culture prescribes at some point for the child to be announced at the child’s father’s home if the mother is still a minor and the child’s father fails to take accountability after paternity is confirmed. Through that process the cooler headed adults at would have clear lines of communication between the parents and themselves to advise. The assumption is also that through age at least they have had the requisite cumulative experience from at least raising the new parents, seeing at least one would have gone through a similar experience or conflict they can impart the lessons they learned. This means at best there is up to 4 resources available to the 2 parents to mediate hopefully to avoid an adversarial, often expensive court process that can end up with all parties worse off.

The rearing of a child to maturity also requires the parents to economise. Often the already scarce resources to provide for the parents themselves, whether as a unit in case of married couples or in their individual capacity if untethered, need to stretch further especially if the parent’s socioeconomic status is low. This means that often parents have to be prudent about their expenses, including time and money. A protracted court case can take a toll on the little resources available to provide for the child for at least the next 18 years. Most of the people involved in the court process have invested and continue to do so their time and resources and as such need to be compensated for it, this cost is ultimately borne by the child in the form of lost resources that could have been diverted towards them. Having the court as a last option in view of the child makes sense, if not for the sake of optimising the resources towards the child but also to preserve at least a working relationship between the birth parents. At best 18 years is still a long time but most likely the child will continue to have a child who will have their own, as long as there are children their best interest must always prevail. With this in view it does make sense to advocate for an approach that can preserve at least a working relationship between the parents while putting the least unnecessary drain on the resources of the parents. If mommy and daddy do not fight and focus on exercising their duties to the best of capacities they will have more reasons to celebrate because the child wins.

This was the departure point I proposed when Buggz was born, his interests first and equality between us in relation to the discharge or our parenting duties and enjoyment of our rights. By the time Buggz was conceived I had the advantage of having 37 credits towards the 40 prescribed by the LLB. This put me at an advantage of being familiar with the law. Before being disillusioned with the Legal fraternity and decided to drop out family law had been a passion of mine, more so because it was most relevant in my pursuit of building my family. During our romantic relationship there had been enough nights I spent studying for my exams for her to have known I had sound legal bases for the approach I proposed. During this time I also came to know she had close friends who were active legal practitioners to advise and protect her against me should I overstep my boundaries. I also proposed one of her friends as a potential mediator, I had met with her and found her to be as successful in motherhood as she had been in her career. Having her fulfil this role being a lifelong friend to Buggz mother was my way of showing I trusted the people she trusted and I was willing to tilt the odds to her favour. The intention was to minimise conflict and show in good faith it was now Buggz that matters, at times I have always known that will come with sacrifices. 

Despite the feelings of anger and rage I have had to call up on my better angels according to Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of our nature  “Self discipline, empathy, morality and reason” to avoid my son being a statistic. Having had a father I know the tangible value he brought to my life and family, as best as he could he taught me the lessons every father hopefully endeavours to teach their child. His life and death would be the greatest lesson to shape my path to raising my son. He taught me the lessons the best way he knew how, enough for me to draw lessons in him even when he couldn’t impart any. 

My father was there for his family. So much so that even when he wasn’t there was enough for my mother to bring 4 children to adulthood, that is all they had to do. Whether I judge him as a party to a contract with my mother to have us or as his successor who had to bear the consequences of his actions I cannot fault him. As a partner to my mother he honoured his half of the contract by providing for us while he was alive, we did not only survive but started to thrive. Even after his demise they had a house for us to call home, income to survive and a mother that was not only strong enough to carry 3 daughters in her back but me, his successor. 

Carrying much of the load meant for 2 as one almost brought my mother to her demise. Tempting as the pleasures of child and teenagehood I could not succumb to them because I had a duty. The man I learned what it means to discharge a duty adequately discharged his while he was alive, even beyond the grave he still was. I tried to blame him for the early departure but that just brought me pain, my mother was still multitasking. When I emphasised on his shortcomings they were already done, even if they could be remedied he was not here to do so, but I was. Unlike him I had the value of his experiences, where he faltered I wouldn’t. His strengths I would amplify while modifying his weaknesses. 

Just as I learned from him I will pass the lessons to my son for him to build upon and pass unto his. None of those lessons included abandoning his family so I will never abandon mine. I watched my mother almost buckle under the pressure of single parenthood, that is not the fate I will confine the mother of my child to. If I did not like it happening to my mother surely it should not happen to my son’s mother. Just like I bore a significant brunt of my father’s load if I don’t carry mine he will have to. 

No matter how bad things were in my childhood my father had it worse, not even by factors within his control but prescripts of time. In my time however things were better, there’s many reasons I could attribute to this but one of those includes the fact that he preceded me. If then his mere presence in my timeline is the reason I have a timeline who am I to judge how that timeline came to be? I could blame him for not having enough money to move out of rural transkei to the suburbs but this was apartheid South Africa, like so many he could have perished before I was. Younger me once blamed him for at least not having more money so that even if he died as he did money would be one less thing for us to worry about. Soon enough however I realised because there was not enough of his money I needed to make enough of mine for everyone to thrive. Its not as if even if he had enough of his it would have been enough of mine, because it would still be his. I blamed his death as the biggest setback for my family, it was. There’d be no extensions to the house, dreams of hand-me-down cars from daddy required a car to begin with and the Ford Courier he bought soon demanded more than it was giving, much more! Amidst the abyss however I discovered as long as I learned the lessons on my way down each time I came I landed higher than before. Just like in the gym the harder I worked the bigger my assets got, the setbacks had turned into a springboard.

I learned the principles of how to be a man from my father, the least I can be is at least his equivalent. Being a man however is only a portion of my being. I learned the principles of my being from my parents, the least I can be is their cumulative equivalent. I learned life has a beginning and an end, father was so prudent I learned the circle of life he demonstrated it. For life to begin nature prescribes a male and female gametes. Seeing my biology teacher would later teach me that from the onset I am a product of competition, I am not afraid of competition and this is the lesson I will pass to my son. 

 I did not however become my father's equivalent nor my parent’s cumulative equivalent, I am better. Had I only learned from them I probably could have been equivalent to them but I had their teachers to learn from in my grandparents as well as their alternate versions in my uncles and aunts. Most of them I will never know but knowing of them is lesson enough some of which I owe my life as they are directly involved in my timeline. Just like I learned from all of them my son deserves just as equal an opportunity to do so, even if some of them the only thing they have to offer is lessons some he will lean on.

It was my father’s sisters and family who came and buried him, continued to support my mother in their own way even after his death. My uncles aunts and grandparents along with their descendents all contributed in their own way to the man I am today, with my uncle stepping in when I stepped out and always the pillar of support when needed. I learned from them and leaned when I had to, so will my son in my sisters and his cousins. My choice to take my mother and sister along with me was inspired by the best of what I learned from my childhood experiences, I only made them better. My parents contributed to the upbringing of their siblings, helping them where they could. The result was functional family that offered benefits down to us as children because I looked forward to seeing my cousins during school holidays as we would visit them. Some of them even grew up at home with us, the relationships served their purpose. When my cousin stayed with us I had an older brother at school, that had its benefits although there were some disadvantages as well. The lessons however I took and made sure I would pass on along with any benefits I can bring.

In his publications Thomas Sowell reveals some data on the conclusions made by researchers in his quest to reveal the fallacy behind equality of outcome. He shows what ought to be evident to all of us when looking at our families, that despite most parent’s endeavours to create an equal environment even in the best of circumstances the results will be different. The siblings will not turn out the same despite the equality of opportunity. What I found more interesting however in his writings was his data on first borns and the tendency of same sex children to want to outdo their same sex parents. Nothing has given me more pleasure in my life than doing better than my father. Despite the anger I harboured towards him in my youth somehow I never lost sight of the fact that I had to do better than him. Admittedly at times this was out of spite because I wanted to prove he could have done things differently so that at worst when he died things wouldn’t be as bad as they were.

It was misguided youthful vigour now that I think of it because what I was inadvertently doing in trying to spite him I was doing what the man had hoped I would. For a name who’s father named him Mlandeli, directly translated to mean follower to name his son Salatiso I should have taken a hint. When I did however I knew there was no greater respect I could pay to my father and all my ancestors, all that had been before I was. It was not through empty gestures veiled as sacrifices to the ancestors that mine would be appeased, but living my life’s purpose as my father had intended. Even his death was the greatest cautionary lesson so I could work towards the purpose I was meant to fulfill. Even if I didn’t know which way I would lead, the rumble in my stomach and the despair in my family’s eyes made it apparent at least where I don’t want to be. Everywhere but there was a good start, my parent’s discipline and mother’s insistence on education would be enough to tame the supposedly uncontrolled young man I was. 

In heading the greatest lesson from my father which he embodied in my name I chose not to follow. When it was fashionable to follow the crowd I sought my own path. I had a choice to follow my star towards my nuclear family and picket fence with 2,5 children I did not follow. I brought my family with me and now even with the one child I have in my son I have more in my nephews and niece. Even with promiscuity seeming like a prerequisite to be ‘the man’ more than one woman seemed like too much for my limited concentration span, somehow I also didn’t think this was a lesson my father wanted to imparted to me as I had never seen him live it. I was winning, beating him with a huge margin, possibly the greatest high of my life. I have after all done what he couldn’t, in a fraction of the time, with my mother and sisters. I know he hadn’t and can reasonably conclude none of my ancestors have, at least sustainably so because if that was the case my start would have been different in life. Relatively I am more successful than any of my ancestors and I am winning!

The self made song quickly fades however as soon as I realise there is no such. For me to be, they had to have been. Nature is never linear and the path to progress has never been smooth. There are challenges my father overcame I think I would have crumbled if I had to face. Granted I still had to walk to school but at least I had good shoes and socks, at no point did I ever have to put my feet in fresh cow dung just to get some relief from the potential frostbites en route to school in the morning barefoot. I have no recollection of being unreasonably refused access or called a ‘kafir’, the nightmare of apartheid was theirs to live through and I am glad they did so that I wouldn’t have to. Recently I took a trip to the ancient world with professor Robert Garland through the The Great Courses: Ancient History series, his perspective of how life was in the daily life of yesteryear in The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World makes me grateful I did not leave through that. Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature merely cemented what I suspected, I am grateful to those that came before me. Whether it was at the hands of another person or nature itself one way or another one will get you. At best they’ll trade it but conquering was more the language our ancestors spoke, so even a peaceful life ends in violence. If then the Hobbesian state of nature was the reality, which evidence suggests it was I am grateful to my ancestors for having lived then. They did the best they could with what they had and now it is my turn to do so. A lesson I will pass to my son.


When my father died it was the worst thing to happen to my family, even more so for me. My sisters at least had my mother and themselves, no matter the challenges they would encounter, at least my mother was still here to coach them through, female to female. The only man I could look up to for the same privilege my sisters had was dead, I felt abandoned. It did not matter that he did not directly choose to be there, what mattered was that he had left me alone with no male guidance. Even worse was that I didn’t have a brother, at least he would have filled in for him in his absence. The man had failed me, instead of fulfilling his duty of teaching me to be a man so that I can best fulfil my purpose in life he was gone.

It was only until I realised even in his death he would teach me the greatest lesson I needed to be the man I ought to be. He valued knowledge so I learned from that, I studied and gained the experience I needed. He worked hard and provided for his family, I had no excuse not to. He honoured his obligations to my mother in relation to their commitment to us as their children, if I did otherwise in relation to the mother of my son that would not be in his name. 

My son will never want for a father, for as long as I live. I committed to my nephews that whether their fathers are there or not, as long as my son has a father they have one too. I know what it is like not to have a father. A lesson I am grateful for. I also know what it is like to have a father figure, I am an uncle and a father figure because I had uncles who inspired when my father couldn’t, teachers who taught me when he couldn’t and mentors who guided when he was not there. Even though I grew up an only son I never wanted for brothers, I’ve always had a brother in my friends. My son may be born alone but in his cousins he has brothers, in time he will also have the privilege of selecting like minded people to be his friends. 

My father did not need to live to teach me what the role of a man is because when he died that role was no longer fulfilled. The first time I would see my strong mother weak would be in the dimly lit room sitting on the floor sobbing her loss. That, by itself says a lot because how she did not fall apart towards his last days bears testament to her strength. I’d only understand his impact on her later as her spark gradually dimmed, the things she used to excel in now settling for good as she spread her competencies to make up for his absence. In some aspects, no matter how bad I had it my sisters had it worse, at least I had spent 11 years of my life with him alive. They were too young to even comprehend what they had lost. 

The current approach implies by default women are inherently better at parenting, that is after all the bases for a rebuttable presumption. There must be enough facts for one to reasonably presume in the absence of evidence to the contrary then the apparent is true. In cases of such nature the outcome has often been the same or is likely to be the same because of this underlying fact ‘The biological reason for committing to a union in a heterosexual relationship  is procreation, thus it is reasonable to assume any offspring that results from such union is theirs’. In this case there is an underlying fact which one can use as a reasonable justification for concluding that the child is of the parties in such union. I cannot help however but wonder what are the bases for one to conclude that women are inherently better suited to be parents? 

They are not just better by a small margin but so much that even the best father is only comparable to the worst mother. This I concluded not only from the many court cases but personal experience as well. In coming to her judgement the magistrate in family court clearly said for her to even consider awarding custody to me as a father the mother would have to be a drug addict. The irony is at no point did I ever imply I want custody, all I have ever wanted was a Constitutionally compliant agreement that prioritises Buggz and treats us as parents on equal bases in all aspects. Seeking a judgement that excluded the mother of my child from my her child’s life could be interpreted to imply I did not think her adult enough for the task. An argument that would have no bases because she was adult enough for me to have unprotected sex with, with full knowledge of the potential outcomes. At that point I had no bases to even make such an allegation, even if I was shortsighted enough to imply such.

Factually we are both of the same age, we have homes and incomes to support our lifestyles. While it is true that I had my objections against her home that was based on personal preference rather than functionality. I was happiest most in my life when my father was alive, this is the period I have consciously and unconsciously spent trying to recreate. My house will always be a home for my mother and sisters, if not for anything I do this in my quest to recapture my childhood. Because my house means so much not only to me I discriminate about where I live, where she chooses to live has nothing to do with me as long as it does not impact on Buggz negative and our ability to discharge our obligations. Until I have reasons to believe otherwise it is reasonable for me to assume that if the house is good enough for her it will be such for him. If I couldn’t have at least that little trust in the mother of my child that would be more a reflection on me than it would on her, I did after all choose her to be the mother of my only biological child.

An argument to deprive her of access would have been self defeating because it would also meant I would be depriving my son of his mother in the least. It is no coincidence that my mother features so prominently in my life, the woman literally breathed for me when I couldn’t on my own. She carried me on her back when I couldn’t walk by myself. I could never deprive my son of such. By the time I was born both my biological grandmothers were no more, somehow I always felt robbed of being spoiled by grandma. I am forever grateful to my non biological grandmothers for giving me life moments to treasure, no matter how good they were however there were no biological bonds between us. My son will never be robbed of his grandmothers for as long as they live, at least not by my doing. He might not have his grandfathers to tell him their stories for him to learn but neither of them grew up alone, they had brothers and sisters who went on to have their own children. He might not learn of his lineage by word of mouth but family will tell him of them from their perspectives. Malicious attempts to deprive the mother of my son of her child would not only harm her but mostly him, at least half of who he is is her and her family.

So if I could not find any justification to deprive her of him I could not understand how she could deprive him of me. We are both old enough to know if one has the requisite resources to parent alone there are legal options for that. No matter how much I tried to reason, an option that would exclude her from his life to preserve my interests would end up with him being the biggest loser. I have never disputed the possible existence of a flaw that could be enough justification for me to be deprived of my child, so I worked hard to satisfy what I deemed to be prerequisites so that I could be worthy. I never dispute the possibility that I would still have to suffer the consequences of the failures of those who went before, they will however end with me. 

I asked the mother of my son to give me reasons to justify her approach, beyond that she does not ‘feel’ I am still waiting for the justification. Buggz is a whole, a product of our individual biological contribution, by virtue of having contributed in proportion to his being, our accountability to him until maturity ought to reflect that. We have just as much opportunity to earn an income so our expenditure must reflect that. In making this income we are bound to commitments away from him, this must reflect against both of us. If it is having a mother who can look after the child while we work I have one too, and if experience counts for anything being a grandmother to her children’s descendents is all the work she has been doing with demonstrable results in my nephews. 

If doing one’s duties is the prerequisite surely I satisfy that. As a son I honored my duty to my father by succeeding him. A duty I have discharged so well that even in his absence my family survived, and now they are thriving thanks to me. The life I afford to my son is the same life I afford to my mother and hers and my parent’s descendants. I honoured my duty to society because even when I couldn’t solve it’s problems I didn’t become one of those problems to be solved. When I could I became a good student with my teachers, lectures and mentors. As an employee I discharged my duties, if career success is the proof then my resume is but just the highlights of my achievements. I have given to society to earn my rights to equal treatment, least of all being my contribution to tax. I was taught so I teach, any investment that was made in me I have paid it back, and then some. Considering I have done my duty and continue to do it I have earned my right for equal treatment before the law. 

My mother did well to teach me to cook for myself and clean-up after myself. If it is domestic competencies that are required I have those too. Demonstrably so and Buggz’s mother once benefited from them so this can’t be the reason. Even when she had the option to leave because what justified her presence in my home was over she chose to stay. A luxury she could only enjoy if my home was not only good enough for me but has enough space for guests. Even in the cottage which is but just a tiny portion of my home she still offered the same security my home offers to my son. The fraction of the conveniences still offered adequate levels of comfort. My son is however not a guest in his home. The conveniences at his disposal for him to enjoy, it’s one thing he will never mistake a TV aerial for the actual TV or wait to be in tertiary use a computer. I’ve worked to make sure that he has access to the world, computers are not just something he will encounter one day but are part of his life. A simple query to Google home informs or entertains, even if he can’t reach the light switch it’ll automatically sense his presence and switch on. So my home nor domestic competencies couldn’t have been the disqualifier because she’s witnessed and enjoyed the benefits. 

I knew however that parenting would be my greatest challenge so I’d need as much help and time as I could afford. I prioritised the intense time consuming challenges in my career for the first 35 years of my life, so that when my son was born he would take precedence and whatever career success I had attained would have to be enough. A choice I made consciously and continue to do so despite the financial benefits and supposed social bribes that come along with being the ‘head honcho’ of some company. What I have earned  I invested towards his future so that even if I died the day he was conceived money would be the least of his problems. In succeeding my father I knew if ever my sisters needed to be, when I can’t, for Buggz to thrive they would have tangible reasons to, where emotion, kinship and sentiment fell short. 

I postponed child bearing to 35, years that I anticipated I should have enough patience and maturity to focus on raising my child. When the time came however I have had to spend more time to prove what ought to be obvious to us all. The nannies that Buggz has had, all of them with the little time they have spent with him have enjoyed more time with my son than I have, and will if Buggz’s mother, private legal practitioners and magistrates were to have things their way. The implication being she can do a better job alone than we can together, I will give her an opportunity to prove this in court. 

Maybe she can inspire him to be greater than I am, as I did want to better my father maybe she will inspire him to attain this manly goal. 

How will she do this independent of me though I wonder. Most likely he will use her as a benchmark for success, if I keep quiet and do as I am told he most likely will never know me. At best I should have perished the day his mother took out a restraining order veiled to imply I intended to harm her or him. If I hadn’t had my father to teach me to prioritise reason over emotion what was alleged I did might have been the truth. My reputation I worked so hard to build, if not for me for the knowledge that one day my son will walk the paths I treaded. Like so many other fathers who had been where I was I would have complied and kept within the confines of the order. My son would only see a shadow of what he is capable of if he views his life through my life because I’d only see him when and where she feels like it. The scenes from Losing Lerato would eventually end up with me either in the morgue or in jail, all for the crime of pursuing my right to be a parent to my child. A story we know so well, we celebrate however that another young man is in jail or dead because he was a menace to society. What if most of them are being a menace because they have depleted all the reasonable means of claiming what ought to be their right, as no one disputes they have an obligation. That is what maintenance courts are aren’t they? Tools that we use to bring ‘good for nothing’ fathers to own up to their obligations? Ironically however we don’t dedicate as much effort in at least eliminating the basic reason for them to feel cheated.

I digress. Another child with no father, an all too familiar trend we see all around. The child will grow into a man and want to define manhood for himself. Should he decide to follow in his father’s and his forefather’s footsteps in the name of culture who will at least guide him to do it safely? My uncles looked after me, she doesn’t have any siblings so who will look after him? What chances does he stand of not being another dead initiate if the only person who had experience in the process is not there? Even if he somehow survives that and goes on to be twice the success his mother is he will still be half the success I am. How can he be anything otherwise, it’s not as if I would have been there to show him how I did it and didn’t so that he could learn from my mistakes. Eventually, half the man he will be since he only learnt from only one side of his family, he will have a child. At best, not to be anything like his father he will be confronted with the same circumstances his father was. The intention and determination not to be like his father will be good but most likely it’s execution will not be as restrained as mine is. It’s not as if I would have been there to teach him to reason through his emotions. His mother will be surprised anyone would restrict her access to her grandchild. He will be angry as his father was but without his restraint. Society will celebrate his demise if the means he pursues for what ought to be his right. The cycle will start all over again. 

In my family however I swore the cycle ends with me. Even in following my father did enough to pave the way for me, doing so towards my son is not only in his honour but a duty I accepted when I consented to being a father. Buggz’s mother wouldn’t have chosen me to father her child if she did not believe I was up to the task of doing what is best for our child, equality between us is what is best right now to ensure our child gets the best from both worlds. I will exhaust all my power and resources towards achieving this ideal, it is after all the just and fair approach hence it is codified in our highest law. Even if I don’t achieve it in my lifetime I will teach those who share this ideal my successes so that they can amplify them, my failures so they can modify them. It is no coincidence that despite being born the only male I am now surrounded by mostly males in my children. It is merely confirmation of the urgency with which I need to resolve this, if that fails the least I can do is to teach them how to navigate a similar situation should they encounter it in the future. Maybe one of them will grow up to join me in my cause, or two of them, maybe all. Maybe with them they will recruit others from all sides because they all stand to lose if the future is devoid of fathers. We cannot lose forever, especially if we have enough resources to build on. Our ability to pass knowledge from one generation to another being enhanced by books and media means if I document my failure, they will have one less stumbling block to worry about. 

 Until such time that this ideal is achieved and justice is rendered 

____________________________________________
My father was a good man, as good a man as my mother is of a woman. Good as they were however in their individual capacities parenting asked for more than good, parenting required nothing less of greatness. Greatness they could only achieve if they leveraged on their complementary strengths to make up for each of their weaknesses. The basic act of providing for a family robbed him of the time he needed to raise us as attentintively as my mother would, while attending to us as efficiently as my mother needed to meant she’d have to sacrifice any aspirations she might have had of conquering the corporate ladder. Their union was that of necessity, neither stood more to benefit by sacrificing either his time to spend as much time with us nor her aspirations to be a career success. 

The tragedy however in their sacrifices is that the one parent who had to sacrifice spending time with us out of necessity would end up being the one spending the least time with us. It is not as if his sacrifice would have counted to anything had he lived and they seperated. Somehow the act of providing for his family, no matter how far that would take him would have been to his detriment if our custody as children ended in court. Justifiably so too because it is not as if he would have had the time to attend to his children if he was bound by work commitments for him to provide. Mother would have definitely outperformed him in every domestic competency, if not for anything because she would have had learned from experience of having fulfilled the role full time before the dispute. So in the best interest of his children his sacrifice would have been his undoing.

My father was there as often as he could, most times he wasn’t there, mostly was because it was in our interests. Having been born in his era I can only imagine the challenges they would have had to overcome if they had insisted on the alternative. The societal and cultural stigmatisation he would have had to endure as a stay at home father. As if accessing getting the resources from home for him as a first born to study enough to get a decent job in pre 1994 South Africa was not an insurmountable task for him, for my mother it would be close to impossible! Any financial resources my grandfather would have had would have likely been exhausted on the children preceding my mother. Assuming they were not or the beneficiaries had been able to earn enough and had enough justification to invest in her she still would have had to break through the cultural expectations and corporate barriers as a woman. In the end I understand their choices to have been out of necessity, while I am grateful they did their best I am sad that despite his best, one way or the other my father did not spend as much of the little time he had. 

Even more tragic is that at this rate my son will be in no better position. He will still be seen only as good a parent next to the worst mother. Even though his financial contribution will be demanded with the support of the highest courts, as they should, any other contribution will only count towards the mother of his child. To his detriment and most likely his demise. Because who after all wants to be seen as only a wallet to a child he fathered, as equal a contribution as that of the mother? 

The death of my father was not a tragedy I needed to mourn but a lesson and a warning I needed to heed. With his death so did I also bury my childhood, an experience I am grateful to have undergone so young. But one I spent my whole life working to ensure that my child would never relieve. While I survived the experience I had my father to prepare me for it, if I am not there how can I prepare my son for his trials? While I am grateful for the lessons as learned from my father’s life, and death just like he entrusted me to, I have found the ways to pass the lessons to his descendents. I spent my whole life preparing to be a father to my son. Every lesson I learnt I would preserve and pass on to him while every failure that tripped me I’d tell him so that at least he can avoid it. I am yet to fail however, I conquered poverty with knowledge, discipline, investing and patience. What I did not know however was that in conquering those challenges I was preparing for the greatest challenge. The quest to be with my son, not for my benefit but because the alternative is to his detriment. I can never afford to lose my son.

My father hadn’t planned adequately for the unforeseen, perhaps they hoped for a fairytale ending of living happily ever after. Life however is not a fairytale, a caution they should have headed in their childhood but one they would pass to me so loudly nothing else was audible. In their wisdom my parents taught me as much of their strengths as they could and I was too eager to learn just as much from their weaknesses. I knew if ever I wished to be a competent parent I would need to study and learn relevant information, so when formal education was the only source of knowledge I learned, until it wasn’t enough. Between the prospect of reliving my father's nightmare of being alone from my children the sacrifice of fun and all other youthful enticements was nothing compared to the prospect of spending as much time as I can with my son the day he is born. Because I do not know if history follows a pattern. So I prepared.

I hoped for the best and planned for the worst, but it would be the worst I’d need to hope for so that I conquer it before it conquers my son. My life was demonstrably better than my fathers, sometimes this took him sacrificing himself for us to be. If my son had to live my life the way I did I will have failed him, how could I expect him to advance the baton if he had to start 2 steps back? The daunting paths my father smoothened I could conquer and thrive, isn’t it then fitting for me to do the same if I wished my son success greater than mine? The benefits that accrued to us as his family came at his cost, if he could bear the burden for his family who am I not for mine? 





While the formal plan would be getting done we still needed to make arrangements so I asked her to avail days and times for contact. For all other obligations the request was for her to supply a list monthly as well as invoices for any expenses she incurred that were due from me.  

The most important thing was making sure that Buggz does not suffer because of our failure to conclude a parenting plan. Buggz' still needed to eat, get clothed etc. so interim arrangements had to be made. I gave her the carte blanche to send me all this monthly. By the time he was 8 months old he moved to my medical aid as well. 

CONSIDER MOVING TO COURT PROCESS
 The prospect of having a third party biased towards her seemed like a brilliant idea, more so because a lawyer ought to bring some justification beyond emotions for an approach chosen.  The Dispute had always been less about what she was saying with regards to parenting but more about why she'd feel so confident to pursue such a flawed approach. I had advanced my argument for mutual parenting and involvement as being primary in Buggz ‘interests as a child needs both parents but also to ours because it would result in less conflict as benefits of parenting would be shared and less resentment as the obligations would also be shared, fairly. Unfortunately however no such argument or at least bases of defence for her approach apart from that's how she felt. The novelty of opposites attracting was after all quickly replaced by reality that had led to the termination of our romantic relationship. His fascination with my logical approach that led to my getting things done quickly faded when she saw and lived the hard work it takes to achieve it. Likewise her whimsical light-hearted emotional approach to life and its inability to get as much done beyond a superficial facade had affirmed my approach to subject emotions to logic. So when she based her approach on emotion I was not surprised, the prospect of dealing with her through a lawyer that wouldn't lack this competency was relieving. 

I could not have been more wrong. I had initially also drew relief from the fact that the attorneys she had chosen was known to both of us, more so to her as they had been lifelong friends. I drew comfort that she would have her best interests throughout, not focus on emotions that normally cloud one's judgement in the short term while doing damage to the future. Sifiso knows very well that even though I value his interests but whenever he has sought help towards a matter that in the long term seemed to prejudice what he ought to value the most, his children I have never been shy to favour his family over him. Likewise he has done the same as has Siya, which is the condition of our friendship. So the prospect of a friend siding with her to protect her best interests, which in this case I saw as Buggz’ best interests should have brought relief. She had, at least once visited my house as I had hers so she had prior information to advice beyond the law.

When I received the draft parenting plan from her attorneys it continued at the same time she had maintained. This did not surprise me and also confirmed that considering she had expressed her intent in what would be a binding document was confirmation she took accountability for the approach she advocated for. It still did now change that I thought it was nonsensical to say the least but having it legitimised by one who practices the law came as a shock. What was even more shocking however was the response when I queried the legal justification behind this approach. Important to note, it's the content that I initially questioned but rather the legal justification which guides it. Below are the questions I sent to them and the responses received.
"" "" ''''''''''''''''"" "" "" "" "" ""
I also noticed the timeline had been conveniently altered to project a different narrative to the truth. The date the romantic relationship was terminated and subsequently the conception had been altered to imply what I could only guess was me breaking up with her to escape my obligation. This would be one of the many frequent times where my over planning would once again come to my aid. I had agreed to allow her to move to one of my cottages at a nominal cost while she made arrangements to go back to her house. While this was not ideal because I always insist on strict detachment after a breakup to either recover from it or reconsider if the relationship is worth saving I couldn't exactly kick her with no alternative. Of course this was an emotional decision because history had confirmed the advantages of severing all ties after a breakup, I had succumbed out of misguided guilt because to be honest considering our inability to co-exist was already glaring by end of 2016 every day after I did not bring it to a halt formerly was merely an opportunity to allow her to make arrangements and when ready move out. The arrangement of her moving to the cottage however allowed for an opportunity to document the business aspect of our relationship as we were either evaluating whether there was still a romantic relationship to be saved. I had to document the agreement as well because I needed to put a provision that would escalate the rental amount monthly to discourage any long term stay. 

At first the aspect of obligations was less important as my interest was at raising my son, I have planned for that boy at least twice over. I had told her this and after I had seen after she moved out she moved between family and friends I figured maybe it was an issue of finance so I had offered I'd cover most of the expenses and she could continue to receive her rental income from letting her place. This however was based on her negotiating in good faith which in this case didn't even had to consider my interests, as long as Buggz' interests were always prioritised I could not see the outcome being a zero sum. 

One of the things I condemned outright was the conclusion that by default she would be entitled to make all major decisions, from where Buggz' stayed which would eventually lead to how he is raised etc. So by default this meant she would be entitled to enjoy all the benefits that come with being a parent, choose which obligations to fulfil as those she would leave them to me. If expressed purely as liabilities and assets the below diagram represents the parenting plan as she drafted it. So as long as I kept my mouth shut while keeping the money flowing she'd be content to be another 'victim single mother' who has to do everything while the father 'shows up when occasionally.  Until one day I get so frustrated enough to withhold the payments the narrative would fit perfectly into me being the occasional father who is good for nothing. Meanwhile the person who ought to be at the forefront when all these decisions are taken grown up missing a connection with at least fifty percent of who he is. Assuming he learns some level of control over his emotion he doesn't land up in jail or caught up in crime as is the trend worldwide for fatherless children, until one day as luck would have it he has a child with a woman who does what his mother did to his father. But because I was not there to teach him restraint and discipline or because he eventually found out what happened to him and is angry he loses control trying to exercise his right. By then conveniently we will have forgotten what got him there, all we will see is a criminal that just abused a woman!

After multiple back and forth exchanges with no progress the negotiations collapsed. I'm not even sure if I should call them negotiations, mine was to do as I'm told because that's how it's always been done. This approach after all has been the norm that has been reinforced by magistrates and attorneys alike. At some point her legal team even expressed what she had implied, I was the father that was doing everything to escape obligation! So what if the agreement was biased, that's how it's always been done. So what if the agreement was not only illegal but unconstitutional at the face of it, as long as tradition was persevered all was well? So what if the flawed approach of using emotion as bases, if the mother's emotions who cares about the father? Most importantly though, so what if the outcome is not in the best interest of the child, it's not like him growing up with less than what he needs is essential to him growing to be a fulfilled and productive member of society is important.

After receiving the parenting plan I also shared it with other people to evaluate it. It's one thing that people have their feelings but the willingness of society to replicate of support them gives them authenticity. The only step now to having such feelings being enforced is having them given legitimacy by the law, and that's it, a feeling which does more harm than good in the interests of conformity and populism is now the truth, Thomas Sowell once said “Some things are believed because they are demonstrably true, but many other things are believed simply because they have been asserted repeatedly.” My test sample was small but big enough to include lawyers at different levels of their career, one a new graduate and another a seasoned professional. I also sought the view of another woman who is also a single mother. The only man I included was in 2 capacities, a legal professional and a future father or uncle. Their response was to gauge beyond the legal impact but also bigger societies view of the issue. As long as I paid and did as little as possible everyone was happy! It wouldn't even take a week before I'd hear of a new study published that shows the disparities between men and women at home, how this is mostly his fault because he works too hard and is never home or when he is home he won't do the dishes or cook, assuming he even works because that good for nothing scrub can't even hold down a job to support his child.

_-----------------------+-+----+++--+-+------

Buggz' birth had been the culmination of all the knowledge I have acquired in my life through experiences. I saw the fact that most of those experiences required resilience to survive as preparation for what I would have to go through so all this happening was no reason to upset my baby's life. To that effect I made sure the disagreements between his parents shouldn't be a cause for deprivation on him so his well-being could not be upset. This meant I had to stomach having to visit him on her terms which were mostly at her house. The logistical implications alone were a nightmare because twice a week I had to haul my family, often in turns with Visa & Solo being disadvantaged the most, since the days were during the week for them to come from work and school to see him was not easy to arrange. Fortunately ride hailing apps proved an advantage for the days Ntobeko was not available to drive them with the Honda. For that period our son, who is born of two parents only had the perspective of one. This coincidentally also happened to be the period where I was building my home with changes happening rapidly, inspiring to Solo who knows how far we've come thus a life lesson. To my son though? How would he know within him he has the strength to not only change the course of his future but also others if he worked hard? From a liability I inherited from my father, that guided a path to a future that would guarantee him a better start, he was the only one who was not there to witness it!

During the subsistence of our romantic relationship Buggz' mother had learnt the significance I place in my home and the work I am willing to put to it. I had given her context to the stability my home brings as I took her to my father's home village and the village I grew up in Eastern Cape. Our first meeting was in my house and she would later move with me to my current home. Because my family is here this is my centre, I happily shared it with her when it was her will to do so. My doors were opened to her friends and family with no problems. She knew what my home meant even though at no point I never gave any impression I wanted her to enjoy he son at her home as long as the arrangement was reasonable. So yes I was not happy. Not happy that the place that literally and figuratively was the base of his life as he was conceived from this house and will continue to enjoy the benefits that flow from it as an investment. 

At no point was I ever vague about going to her house during the relationship, I can probably count all the times with my fingers and if ever the duration exceeded an hour or two it was rare. I pride myself for having gone strength to strength to build a safe and comfortable home, her choice to move in and surrender her room for income validated this. The option not only exposed Buggz to his other half but gives him time to bond with his cousin brothers and sisters, whom, from his father will always be the only brothers and sisters he will ever have.

But, in the interest of peace I continued with the arrangement. The prospect of the mother of my child being less than the person I thought her to be was hard to swallow, even with all the evidence. Self-interest I guess because in her I had believed even when we were no longer enough for each other, our child would always be our priority. Evidence suggests I may have been wrong but I keep hoping. As a last resort before approaching the family advocate I suggested Buggz should come for visits, a suggestion that wasn't met with kindness. As one of her conditions she required a social worker to come visit. Confused was the least of my reactions beneath the anger as I saw this as an insult. Let alone that my home was enough for her and her people she now needed validation to confirm what she knows? Milande and Mila being under two years were happy being raised with Solo by their mothers, grandmothers, aunt's and uncle but someone needs to come and take a snapshot to prove this? Ironically I had expressed my aversion to her house for my own reasons but never expressed concern beyond reason as I believed she wouldn't let her child be in a place she wouldn't. 

One of Siya's value to me is his profession, as is everyone in my life. Between him and his wife there's at least 2 doctors who are at hand and have been very helpful thus far, so whatever my family lacks between the 2 doctors and 4 mothers who live in my household the medical aid which I pay for will cover it. As a result until my vasectomy I can't remember the last time I was in hospital and even that took a couple of hours. It's been business as usual with Solo, Milande and Mila; neither of the last 2 have slept in hospital and they are healthy children. Buggz' however would probably recognise a hospital bed from a mile away. This shocks me because of all the children Buggz has been the only one who's had  unscheduled Paediatrician visits more than Milande and Mila's doctor's visits combined. At some point she expressed how she didn't want Buggz surrounded by sick people, I think it was winter season and people were getting sick as usual, including my family. I'm not sure whether she is raising Buggz in a vacuum but the intent behind the veiled insult was clear, just another way to limit contact. Fortunately I had stumbled into microbiology and epidemiology in my first and second year so I could factually disprove the allegation. Buggz' is also the only one of the children with a "clean diet" that has a special food  amongst other things, yet Mila and Milande who have the food we as adults deem healthy enough to eat are no less vital, in fact if Milande was the yardstick for physical activity my son would be shamed. So her as a first time mother, in a house with a mother whose only ever had her as a child knows more than the collective who have at the top the mother who raised the son she deemed good enough to have a child with?

The tendency to build capacity rather than outsource has always seemed more sustainable. In case where money was not enough to procure external help if one knew what to do they'd still be able to survive. It was with this spirit I've built a life I happily share with my family, because of the proximity we can raise the next generation as a family. My mother's experience raised use, with her help Visa has raised Solo and as such it continues. My children are blessed, they needn't wait until holidays to visit their cousins, aunt's, uncles or grandmother. They enjoy the wisdom as it worked for their parents, adapted by their parents for them. Solo as a result is a straight A student, academic and karate who, even having changed provinces in the last 3 years has never had any issues because he's always had family as a constant. Even when schools changed his grandmother and aunts were there. When provinces changed we were all there. Buggz' in return has had 3 nannies changed thus far and an immature suggestion to send him to preschool at 2! 

_--------+++---+----+-


Chapter 12: The incident
I had opted to have a neutral party whenever I visited Buggz, more out of paranoia but just as much out of practicality. At times when I couldn't have someone with me I'd get a reprieve when I arrive with mostly his mother not there or at least there with someone else in the house. This was important on the paranoia part because by now she had proven her capacity for malice; the blatant stance to dictate the terms and limit the contact with Buggz, the insinuations I wanted her to miscarry Buggz, convenient forgetfulness that shows a timeline that paints a different picture from the truth, point is I had enough evidence to justify my paranoia!

The prospects of seeing the family advocate whom I thought would get through to her was enough to make the unreasonable arrangement pass by quick enough. As luck would have it however in December for one reason or the other no one was available to come with me but I needed to see Buggz because missing just one slot mostly means waiting until the next week. As usual on the day when I arrived I parked outside her property on the street and proceeded to enter after she opened the main and burglar gate for me. The details of the incident are contained in the affidavit but the long and short of it, the one day I relax a control in hope reason would prevail is the day I almost cost my son a father. 

The allegation was nonsensical to say the least, because I had been abusive she took out an interim restraining order barring me from entering her bedroom, not the house nor property but the bedroom! This did not show the reason I was there to begin with on the day was based on an arrangement she had confirmed, she opened two doors voluntarily and the only reason I walked beyond the sitting room was to tell her since she insists on saying Buggz is asleep, was to tell her open because rather than subject myself to such I'd come back the next time. So in a second I could lose everything for being in a place I detested, her house, at her insistence, with her permission. 

Crafting my defence was relatively easy, more so because my paranoia had also made me insist on written correspondence. Her main allegation was that I came at a time I wasn't supposed to, let's forget that she opened 2 gates for me to enter. I had as you will see on the affidavit an email which would come to my defence amongst other things, overall it was my caution that afforded me enough to defend myself, I wonder though how many have lacked this and if it ever happened to any of my kids will they have enough to defend themselves, for exercising their right to be part of their children. I wonder.

Outline the court processes 
Of all the legal gurus I encountered in the process it was only the Family Advocate that gave bases behind the legal approach and as luck would have it she was the only one who had a consistent understanding of what we thought we all read in the law. I had managed to investigate the mediation process, a task that was not easy by itself as I had  

Chapter 13: Equality

The male and female roles were still fairly defined in rural Eastern Cape in my childhood. As a result the expectations from each sex from childhood to the grave were fairly mapped out; the young girls would primarily focus on the household chores and cooking while the boys looked after the cows and crops in the field. In adulthood the expectation would be the woman eventually getting married and having children she must look after while the husband was expected to provide for his family. Even in my home this tradition was adhered to, my mother’s primary and sole responsibility was looking after the home including us while my father was away, often for days at a time at work. This model however was always flawed for various reasons but most notably its inability to promote independence in each party, I’d later live through the consequences of this deficit.

Once again continuing in her norm of bucking the trend my mother never enforced this inefficient approach on us. From as long as I can remember I have always been able to cook, clean and other general tasks that had been previously reserved for girls. Whether her teaching and making sure I was competent in these tasks was part of her plan to build me into the man I am today or it was a consequence of necessity considering I was the first born and would have been the first one to be able to help her around the house. It also didn’t help that the closest thing to livestock we had was a couple of chickens, so by default even if they were determined for me to look after the livestock there was none to be looked after!  No matter the reason I am grateful she taught me these skills because they would go on to serve me for the rest of my life! 

By the time I left home to stay in Mbalenhle I was pretty much self-sufficient, one of the qualities that made me keep a profile low enough to survive my teens.  At tertiary I could make a decent meal, even following cooking shows and experimenting with different recipes by my mid 20’s. Of course as a teenager I had followed closely romantic movies and music that preached a man who could cook would be a good value proposition to prospective mates, so considering I was awkward with the fairer sex most of my youth I figured this would increase my odds. I was wrong, by a long margin which is uncharacteristic of me but here I am. I’d eventually learn while there is a stereotype women want a man who cooks, cleans etc. the reality was a little off. 

I’d learn the hard way that as if my then obsessive attitude was not enough knowing to do all these things made me notice when they are not done well. Apparently it’s taking things too far breaking up over dirty dishes in the sink but here I am, I can attest to severed relationships purely for leaving dishes in my sink.

In retrospect my obsession for order and cleaning up had been justified. For the longest time in my life I was angry. Angry at my father not only for dying but leaving me to clean up after him. It was only fair that I’d later associate the two and by then it was too late I’m too set on my ways. Of course it was only through maturity I’d make the connection, maturity which also changed my perspective on the whole issue being a negative. Call it adaptability but later in my life I’d learn ‘there’s nothing so bad no good can come of it’.

So it came as no surprise that from my first relationship in my 20’s there had never been a segregation of roles or expectations of conformity. More than anything by then I had taken quite a liking in cooking, in retrospect it was because of my newfound independence in my rented flat. Since order was not only something I practiced at home but my career demanded it as part of preventing workplace incidents I was always wired to maintain good housekeeping and cleanliness. It has never been so much that I liked cleaning, I actually hate it! Unfortunately however I had seen the consequences of the opposite and considering I hated that more keeping my house clean and orderly was the lesser evil.  My then girlfriend never complained. Couple to the fact that I could ‘provide’ I figured my odds would increase at landing and keeping a mate towards my white picket fence and 2.5 children. Again I was wrong! Yes for someone who is never wrong I’ve been nothing but so far. I’d later learn that my independence made partners feel not needed which apparently is a bad thing, for someone who had lived through the consequences of the former I celebrated this deficit because to me it was an attainment of a goal. 

I’ve always believed a romantic relationship that is less about the needs because they are taken care of and more about the wants is purer. I mean with no money to worry about because bills are not only paid but there aren’t any, the babies are taken care of and everyone handling their own ish wouldn’t that make for a couple that’s forever in-love? And truth be told for those as fortunate as I am never to have been party to such a relationship haven’t we all, at one point or another, seen the dire consequences of parties to an abusive relationship but have little choice but to stay because they are dependent on the other?

Now to be fair I’m not the one to talk or formulate opinions about romantic relationships because they have always baffled me. My mother of course is to blame for this because I suspect her strict regime while raising us might have resulted in me missing out on lessons informally learnt while playing/ looking after the cows in the veld. That woman always had a strict schedule for as long as I remember, it didn’t help that she acted in unison with my father in enforcing this while observing it herself. We’d wake up on typical weekdays and prepare for school, it was a non-negotiable that your clothes must have been washed and ironed on Sunday latest. Even in instances where the school clothing was not enough for each day she still expected you to make sure that your shirts are washed and ironed the previous day, the same applied for shoes, all this just so you could have enough time in the morning to prepare with no rush. So after finishing preparing and cleaning up after yourself with dishes washed after eating the expectation was that you go straight to school, study and after school you come directly home. Only after your chores were done could you go out and play with a non-negotiable expectation that you’d be back by 6 because after that time the gate gets locked! To this day I still can’t leave my house untidy, that’s assuming I leave at all because unless I have a productive appointment outside you’ll struggle to get me out, I’ve always been all the company I need.

She was never shy to tell us that while our age she once made a mistake of not cleaning up after herself as she was rushing to school. Upon discovering this my grandmother didn’t waste any time and headed for her school. With a full class, after chatting to the teacher my grandmother announced what my mother had done. As if the embarrassment was not enough she’d still be subject to punishment later for the misdemeanour. Now to put things in perspective my grandmother died when my mother was 11! I couldn’t afford to be more of an outcast by having my mother embarrass me because the fact that I was on top of my class most of my life didn’t make me popular. 

My epistasis didn’t help either because by preventing me from participating in sports my social interactions were quite sparse outside of school hours, whether this is what resulted in my cautious approach towards people or I was naturally born to enjoy my own company more than that of others remains to be seen. As a result some of the things that were deemed acceptable to my peers and society have always been illogical to me thus I couldn’t conform. Equality with regards to running the household jointly and flexibility to do both previously manly and feminine tasks was but just one of the differences that made me odd in this regard. The same confusion continued with regards to treatment of the opposite sex. Because at home I had younger siblings who happened to be girls I was obligated to be protective towards them. So when I discovered that apparently as a man it is acceptable to beat one’s partner for whatever reason or have multiple partners while she wasn’t allowed to do the same I felt totally out of place. As if it wasn’t enough that this attitude was seen as manly by most of the guys it was actually seen as normal by the women. Now I did not identify with any of this because I figured if it was ok for me to treat someone’s sister like that it would mean I couldn’t object when such was done to mine. Even worse is that I had no exposure to my father beating my mother so such was not normal. Needless to say to date I have never done any of those things because it has always felt like I’d be giving permission for someone else to beat and cheat on my sisters.

Even though there was a very clear segregation in the roles between my parents at no point did I ever think less of them in their individual capacity, especially in my early childhood? My father’s ability to provide financially was never made to portray my mother as being less in her competencies and role in the family. More than anything it actually put him at a disadvantage because for days and even weeks at a time he’d be away from his family walking rural Eastern Cape as an Inspector from the Department of Agriculture. 

My mother on the other hand would learn later how flawed their model was when the absence of the provider suddenly meant she had to be one. I could never fault her though in her role, nor could I ever be deluded enough to think because her’s was not as easy to quantify as money she was not my father’s equal. For my home to run money was just a small portion, each party had their own tasks to complete towards ensuring that the household ran smoothly. The only flaw however with the model was the inability of each of them to be competent in all tasks just in case they didn’t have each other to count on, as was eventually the case. 

Fortunately though I never had such shortcomings. Pusha T said it best Alone in Vegas
“You gotta be better than the ones who precede yah
Upgrade them
Upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them”
I had to learn from their mistakes so that I don’t repeat them to the detriment of my descendants, and I did. My father’s prospects at success alone were always limited because making money is one thing, spending it wisely however is another. And despite my mother’s ability to build and run a home first there needed to be a home, with limited education and traditional/ cultural barriers her prospects were just as bleak. 

I have no such problems, however, because it was my job to fix it, I have always amplified their strengths while eliminating the weakness. Consequently I was able to eliminate any potential distractions from the opposite sex in pursuit of the opposite partner who’s replace my mother in my life, there was nothing to replace because even her competencies I bettered them. To be fair though it’s not as if the bar was set high to begin with, it is so pathetically low I could have crawled over it! More than an insult that is a complement on how well they did when they were supposed to because thus far no matter the challenge I’ve never budged, anything I want, I always get, in fact I thrive on defying the odds!

So by the time I started dating my expectation was that this model would be the fundamental bases for any romantic partnership, equal contribution and participation towards running the household. One of the things I’ve been wrong about! With no fail in more than 99% of the relationships I’ve ever had there’s been nothing but inequality. Despite my selection criteria which was always biased towards educated and independent partners that’s been a myth. The first issue would be that even in the unlikely scenario that she’d match my income the amount of contribution towards expenses would never be the same with me expected to pay more. This had never been really an issue because ultimately most of the time would be spent at my house, so I figured it’s my house anyway whether that partner is there or not it must run as it should. But you’d think one would, in light of their financial shortcomings be willing to put more effort so as to even the input of both partners, nope! At one point I figured since I’m so pedantic about hygiene I’d just buy a dishwasher, something I’ve never needed because it’s not as if it’s any significant effort to one dishes for one/ 2 people. That too still fell short because now the next issue was putting the dishes in the dishwasher and taking them out after cleaning. Fortunately though this has always been quite easy to eliminate because if one is the source of the problem then getting rid of them would solve it, hence I’ve never had issues terminating romantic relationships that were only equal as far as it was convenient for them. Seeing that I built my life with no dependence on any partner I’ve never had any problems parting ways with people that risked destroying what they couldn’t build. Later I’d be accused for being too quick to end relationships without putting as much effort as I have on things I deem worthy to save the relationships. Not that this bothered me because the fact that I wasn’t putting the effort was an indication of how little they meant to me in the bigger scheme of things. I could never understand this expectation of chivalry because as far as I understand equality abolished it, it can’t be that when it’s convenient I’m expected to bear the burden of looking after another person when that person is not willing to consistently do the same. 

On Culture

The first time I took a stand and blatantly ignored my culture was a year or 2 after I had started working. As it was explained at the time since it had been some time since my father died there was an obligation to slaughter another cow and do a traditional ceremony. This requirement or expectations would manifest in different ways, other through fulfilling the expectation or one elder in the family would tell you they had a dream when the dead was cold and as such needed a blanket. This would be done through a ceremony/ event with family immediate and from afar, community members and acquaintances.

In the days of yore before coffins the burial process was a little different. To ensure that there would be some sustenance for the mourners a cow would be slaughtered, the hide would be used to wrap the corpse. Nothing untoward about the practice and the logic behind it was clear except for one tiny detail, my father had been buried in a coffin! It was when I started getting hints on how overdue doing this ritual was that I actually further questioned most of my culture because on the face of it the proposition was ludicrous to say the least. Apparently I was supposed to take my already not enough income and buy these provisions which would include the cow, groceries, liquor etc. The problem is that my father was already dead, I had 4 live people that were more of a priority in my mother and sisters. Of Course I never complied with the expectations and continued to assist my mother and sisters instead. It didn’t help matters that the circumcision school I had undergone on my last year of tertiary never shaped up to be anything like what it was supposed to be. I expected life lessons that would prepare and shape me to conquer whatever lied ahead of me as a man, needless to say other than the excruciating pain I gained learned nothing! I had voluntarily underwent circumcision more out of necessity than anything, strong and relentless as my mother was tradition dictated there were things which were only reserved for man and with her husband dead unless I stepped up the family would be prejudiced to some degree. 

I’d later do the traditional ceremony, probably one of the last before I denounced most of my culture for being illogical. This was now around 2013/ 2014, more because I could afford to but also because I’ve always believed before condemning practices I needed to factually prove them flawed through practical research. It also helps that money was not that much of an issue by then, considering I had 2 properties by then each with its own car and a solid income that I knew how to spend optimally. I will also admit that despite my vehement condemnation of outdated practices which have no objective benefit in today’s world I can’t deny I did manage to see a lot of relatives some of whom I probably would never meet. I’d later find out that there was a belief if one did the ceremony they would be showered with blessings thus be fortunate in their life. Even better is that these fortunes wouldn’t be confined to the immediate family of the dead but everyone who attends the ceremony. While I appreciated the former benefit to a small degree the latter was dismissed as garbage. I knew by then for me to get the fortunes I want as had been the norm before the only way would be to plan like a madman, push until every obstacle is cleared and know on every door until either my knuckles bleed or the door breaks. There was no mysterious force, just being prepared.

Growing up I was always surrounded by abject poverty, while at home we didn’t have much even after my father died relatively speaking we were far much better off. Poverty however was not the only common trait amongst the people, strict observance of traditional practices was just as common. So from as young as I could remember I was sceptic about the perceived positive effects that would flow from observance of one’s forefathers. Considering these traditional practices were supposed to be lessons from the elders that would help the descendants navigate their way through life it also didn’t help that these lessons were coming from people I considered failures since they were just as poor as the masses today. It also doesn’t help that despite their supposed wisdom and intelligence they were conquered. Of Course this is the part of our history we conveniently forget and instead of saying it like it is because it’s so embarrassing we choose to say the land was stolen, as if it will change the fact that we lost a war! As if that was not enough it also doesn’t help that despite the numbers we still lost, despite the home ground advantage we still lost, despite our strict observance of tradition and willingness to appease our ancestors we still lost! Considering at birth I was mandated to lead my family to a path of success, which was further reinforced as I was growing up through preparing and training me to be competent for the task success has always been inherent to my being. Maybe that explains why my mother nor any elder in my family for that matter never questioned my approach, abrasive and direct as it is.  



On “That guy”

It goes without saying that from the first time I heard about him “that guy” has always been an inspiration to me. Despite growing in an environment that said the only way to make it was getting a qualification so that you can get a job “that guy” took a risk and swam against the tide. While I was raised in a household that valued education and as such grew to have the same appreciation how that eventually got to be interpreted by society as qualifications baffles me. At some point it stopped being about learning skills that could help you change your life but rather how prestigious the qualification was, input was suddenly celebrated as an output and the last money we had after spending every cent to obtain this qualification was spent celebrating this empty achievement. Even worse is that our interpretation of qualifications meaning competence resulted in society disregarding people who were truly competent because they didn’t have some piece of paper.

I’d would take me almost 10 years to meet ‘“that guy”. To date there’s few people I hold with as much esteem as Mawethu, the man is the true definition of hard work and success, so much so he is deservedly respected as my older brother in my life. Ironically when we met there was very little evidence of his greatness because he too had had to get a job while quietly putting his plans together. But in no time Mawethu finally decided to quit his job with nothing but a bit of savings, his natural intelligence and sheer hunger for success which often mean sleeping is a luxury he can’t afford. Mawethu did something that up until then had only been a myth to me, he made it but in a way that wasn’t consistent with conventional wisdom. Even to this day we still chuckle about how incompetent he’d be perceived if he applied for a CEO position in one of the corporates yet he has single handed built a multi-faceted business that propel him to one of a few industrialists in this country. Yes because he doesn’t have a piece of paper he’s been replaced by lesser people who have more papers, and we wonder why our country is where it is.

Maybe my admiration for “that guy” was because I’ve never seen myself as an entrepreneur. 



On Role Fluidity as an extension of Equality
Having been born in a society that defined a man by his ability to provide for his family I've always felt the pressure. I'd like to believe that such was not enforced in my house but rather a consequence of reason. I would however be lying if I pretended as though I was impervious to tradition. My role as my father's successor dawned quite early in my life. The realisation also came with the amount of obligation that goes with such role, even when there's minimal liabilities the burden of having to lead a family is never a light one on a teenage boy. 

Inversely I've witnessed the pressure that has been put on women to have as many children as possible to prove their worth. It is perhaps one of the reasons why when I condemn my mother's decision to continue having more children despite their limited means, a decision that would later place a burden that would almost lead to her demise, that I understand. In a society that has evolved to put individual rights thus choice at the centre the pressure that must be on those women that choose not to have kids is sadly understandable, even my sisters were subject to judgement when they sailed past 20 with no children. 

Perhaps I understand because I'm no stranger to pressure, judgement and condemnation on the basis of defying the norm. Apparently my father's name depended on me as the first and only male to survive so having children as early and as many as possible would have elevated my family name. And I'd choose instead to wait 35 years to have my first born whom I'd ensure is my last by having a vasectomy a month after his birth. I can't really blame society for my choice to succeed my father in the traditional sense and fortunately I've also chosen never to be party to a relationship where I was expected to provide. But that doesn't mean I never felt the pressure. 

Pressure that has left so many of us filling incomplete because we couldn't conform to expectation. Pressure that has broken families because the thought of "what will people say" was too much to bear instead of embracing ones child for who they chose to be. Pressure that sadly some couldn't handle and perished whether by their own hand or otherwise. Pressure that is a consequence of not only unreasonable stereotyping but unequal expectations between sexes.

But what if we could live in a world that would condemn such unreasonable pressure? A world that afforded everyone equal opportunity to be whatever they chose to be without stereotyping or conformity expectations. Men could be free to look after the children and household while the mother is at work if that what pleased both partners. Where men who couldn't earn as much were dismissed as inadequate instead of affording them the opportunity to showcase where his talents might be, at home changing both the lightbulbs and nappies. That world is this world, equality being such an important aspect that it's even enshrined in both ours and most countries Constitution. So even if I chose to stay in the past defying moral principles I'd be a criminal because I'd be breaking the law. But I don't. I relish the prospect of my son growing up with the opportunity to choose whatever path that will lead to him reaching his full potential. I work so that I can ensure that even if he chooses to succeed me it will be out of his own volition. Mila has already shown a keen interest in putting things together, no doubt Atha's genes at work with his pedantic attention to detail, I'm thrilled she is growing in a world that will allow her to be the Aerospace Engineer that eventually owns the company, should she so choose.  

Chapter 14
WRITE YOUR TITLE
My attraction to Buggz mother was always based on our differences, it is possible I might have taken the adage “opposites attract” a little too far, at face value at least. The reality however is that the was logic in the approach, if a child wholeness is predicated on equal contribution genetically to child then it made sense the only way I could increase the chances of Buggz getting a wider variety of competencies, genetically or otherwise was to make sure that the contributors had different but complementary attributes. As such this approach in selecting a potential mate to breed preceded the relationship, we had to differ in a complementary way. 

The first complementary difference is obviously necessitated by nature, otherwise human beings would have been born with the ability to reproduce asexually. This however had to be extended to the environment on which my child would be born into and subsequently raised. As parents we had to have been from different upbringings and different approaches to navigating life, where it mattered at least. Considering that we are all a product of our experiences to a large enough degree, the more diverse the experiences the wider the perspective I figured. For Bugg’z sake it was also important that the source of such experience has to be personal enough for him to identify with it, what better way to ensure identity than having such descend from the parent? Considering the socio economic conditions of my upbringing there were a lot of things that I couldn’t identify with despite being told were possible. In fact, if it wasn’t for the fact that my parents embodied what they taught us as kids this would have been even worse. 

The crucial parameters I was looking for included; Socio economic background, Upbringing, Schooling & Career, Social interests and hobbies. By the time I was 17 I had already formulated my path in life, this was all based on the environment I had been brought up, not only my parents and extended family  but also the community and location. 
When I turned 10 my mother started to relax enforcing most of the rules they (mother and father) had prescribed towards me. This was mostly because she didn’t have to, by that time because of what I was exposed to daily within my rural community I had seen enough to see the logic and reason behind them. 

It also helped that by then I already had my life’s purpose and had seen the benefit of observing those cautionary rules from home. It was not only in the meaning of my name that I knew what I had to do but also the order in which they were assigned would later prove to have a meaning as well. While at first I may have been puzzled how my parents, being in a position of power and authority, relative to me at least would trust a child to “show them the way”. At some point I even thought they had done this consistent to most other parents who had given their children names with purpose but never empowered them to deliver on this purpose. 

My parent’s relaxing of the rules while I was still reasonably young leaving me to make the choice was but just one of those examples I saw that showed that they really trusted me to deliver on my purpose. Even spanking or any physical means of enforcing compliance reduced to a point that after I was 11, I have no recollection of my mother ever raising her hand on me to enforce/ prove a point. I figured this was to allow me to do my own research, taking into consideration what they had instilled and formulate my own strategy that would eventually lead the way out of poverty. ‘Salatiso Lonwabo’, that order of my names I’d interpret to mean I needed to ‘Do what I needed to so that I could do what I wanted to”. In my name I knew what my purpose was, the only thing that I needed to do was to adapt the meaning to suit the circumstances. Buggz’s name is at least 15 years older than him because by 2003 I had already decided what his purpose would be should he choose to accept, the only thing that was outstanding was to create an environment that would be conducive in preparing him to deliver on the purpose. 

The benefit of the differences were not only meant to benefit Buggz, or at least were never meant to benefit him to our detriment as parents, quite the opposite. 
1.	Socio economic background. 
2.	Upbringing
3.	Schooling & Career 
4.	Social interests and hobbies

Some of the most notable of these complementary differences include;
●	When I met Bugg’z mother we were at different places in our careers with different future plans. For all intense and purposes I had decided by 2010 that corporate was not for me. Consequently I started planning on reducing my expenses, diversifying my income streams and learning new skills I’d probably sell to sustain my life without having to be confined to the corporate environment. By then the more and more I tried to justify the affirmative action and BBBEEE policies in the country that are supposedly meant to advance certain categories of people were almost impossible to justify. I just couldn’t understand how, if as codified in the constitution and other laws of the country I am equal as a black person to every other race then why should I need anything other than merit to progress? If I’m equal then why should I need help to advance, at the expense of another race? Even worse was that instead of making things better they were having the opposite impact, not only on the supposed beneficiaries but the country as a whole. The suspicion from white peers when I got a job as a black man that it was not that I was the best choice but because I was black. Consequently I found myself having to work at least twice as hard to prove that I really got the job because I was the best, not because I was black. Not necessarily a bad thing at first considering I yearned for as many opportunities to learn as possible, I’ve always figured while I had youthful vigour and enthusiasm I might as well work myself like as slave so that by the time I neither have the benefits of youth and burdened by added responsibility of adulthood I should have gotten to a place where I’d be content. 

Chapter 15: Conclusion
L
When my father died it hurt, so I cried. This reaction was normal, it was afterall how everyone was reacting around me so even if I somehow was impervious of the pain as a child it was normal for me to follow suit of adults. The loss of a father to me as the only boy in the family felt even more isolating because at best my sisters still had themselves and my mother. I on the other hand was alone, how could he have done this to me?

It did not take long before the the tears were replaced by anger as life got harder for my mother. As if the dreary grey attire she addorened was not enough to incite anger the fact that he had gone and left her to fend for us alone infuriated me. It would be the end of my childhood that I think infuriated me most because I could not just sit by and watch my mother fend alone. She’d have not only the task of having to raise us responsibly but also fend off the pressure from the community and family based on cultural expectations. If God was supposed to be benevolent how could he allow my father to die? Right until his death we had been doing very well, the days of moving from rental house to rental house had been replaced by a home. No more were we solely dependent on public transport because there was the ford courier, no matter how unreliable it was. And both my younger sisters were born into a life where they’d not only know what a TV is but have it at home. Then he goes and dies.

It was at that moment I swore even though I would honor my obligation as a first born to succeed my father the struggle would end with me. Even though that meant I would have to forgo my childhood I swore it would end with me. If ever I were to prove myself worthy of being a father I would have to prove if my demise came before my son could reach manhood, as my father’s did I would learn from his shortcomings. While my son would moan my loss my loss as I do my father’s everyday it’s impact would only be emotional;
He would never have to watch his mother struggle with the task of having to learn and cope in a new vocation she never wanted, so I made sure the prospective mother of my child is a career woman. Someone whom even if all my fortunes were to be eroded in my estate she would be competent to at least raise him to maturity. I felt the obligation of having to be both a child and support my mother, none of my descendents should ever have to.
My vasectomy was within a month of his birth. My choice to eliminate any prospects of another biological child were to make sure that even if I couldn’t provide for his future the most he’d have to cope with is himself and descendents. I’ve watched enough people falter with their siblings, with family bonds turned to opportunities to exploit. Fortunately I had enough lessons with my parents to know how to not only tolerate but mutually benefit with my siblings. That however is a job. When they couldn’t I had to carry them, even if it was only for a short period it is a load not so many can bear. I did and will always do, which means even though he might not have a sister or brother from me he always has a shoulder to count on in Solo, Milande will be by his side and Mila will support him as Visa does me. 
The struggle my mother went through as a single mother of 4 was enough for me to vow never to put any woman through that. Even though it worked out eventually with her life as testament it was a load no single person should ever have to bear. If my time had been up when his was starting even in my absence I have a support system that only values him higher than it values me. My mother has, in me, then Solo and now Milande proven that she is not only a good parent but despite the odds can raise men. Visa is the sister that made the brother I needed redundant. Tina and Kwakho know their duty towards family, because they have and probably are beneficiaries of being part of a working family. 
My obsession with building a home would always ensure that even if I were not here to service the bond, the house would sustain itself. The experience of growing up with no electricity mean that I learned how to have electricity when no one else does, so the home now can generate its own. The tanks that saved me the treacherous task of having to go to the river for water so many years ago mean that even if electricity fails and ths there is no power to the pump my home will never be without water. And what currently is a unit for Kwakho, Tina etc can be converted to income generating units to replace any active income I would have had to live to pay.
Even if I were to leave R13,000.00 it would only be for him, a far cry from where I come from. I could never have left him that though because in anticipation of his coming I worked hard to build wealth. When I needed expertise I found mentors to guide me towards career prosperity. Friends were there to advise when I was too apprehensive to invest into property. Despite being born the only male he’s always have father-figures to guide whenever needer, I have Mkhuluwa’s, Mninawes, Friends and so many more that I would do the same if needed.

Even as a child it did not take me long to notice the disparities that existed in my community. While I was born into a family that did not have much I was still better off than most, an indication of the harsh realities that most children still go through even today!

Having been born into parents whom, they were not content with having to scrape the bottom barrel it was inevitable I would challenge the norm like they did. 

As a child born into a traditional community that reinforced its practices through social norms I couldn’t be oblivious of what society, through tradition expected of me. The expectation to support my family as is the case with many like every first child is often expected to be more than a foregone conclusion. ‘Black Tax’ we call it, a system that sees most people who come, often from large families struggling to break the poverty cycle since before they can even walk they already have obligations to support their families. Just like it was the case with our ancestors many still view having many children as a God given right. This is further encouraged through Christian scriptures that get interpreted to reinforce the prevailing traditions. Unfortunately however because the right to have children is not matched to one’s ability to provide for them, assuming the parents can even provide for themselves, this task ultimately has to be borne by the children themselves.

This means that these children, rather than the blessing they are claimed to be are seen as a potential source of income to support the family. It doesn’t take a huge effort to uncover the statistics of girls as young as 12 years married off to older men in exchange for materialistic possessions which benefit the parents at the expense of the child. Even if the marriage is age appropriate and consensual lobolla is still the prevailing tradition, one however that has been reduced to an opportunity for profit. So in addition to the ‘black tax’ burden the young couple has another debt to add as they start their lives.

This means even in the best of circumstances the probability of the cycle of poverty being broken is doomed. The young couple often subscribe to the same traditional practices that ended with them being overburdened before they even know the meaning of the word. Deviation from the norm, while no longer blasphemous still results in public scorn and condemnation. So rather than look into the future the African child must always bear the burden of the past. 

So if it is not because of tradition that always requires one to appease the dead through lavish ceremonies, most of which have little to no relevance to one’s chances of success in life it will be due to black tax that the African child will be held back. The sad part however is that all this suffering is self-imposed. In most circumstances the birth of a child is a consequence of decisions by parents in their individual capacities as adults. It is the parents that decide to succumb to societal pressure by bringing children to a life they haven’t prepared for. It is the parents again that will make it acceptable for their daughter to be exchanged for monetary benefits that will eventually do the couple more harm than good. 

While I could see the justification for the prevalence of these practices before access to educational resources I have always struggled to see how they could still persist to appeal to such a large populous. This is despite the prevailing evidence which is Africa’s economic reality, where an image of an African child still inflicts gory images of slums, hunger and pain. I don’t know what will it take to make us realise at the base of it all it is the individual that ought to take accountability for us to change the future. 

When a child is born it is mostly out of a conscious choice by the parents, how the government is blamed for individual shortcomings evades me. When that child eventually fails to progress as quickly as others in escaping the shackles of poverty, until maturity at least it is the parents that ought to take accountability. But when such practices continue to prevail at our permission because we do not condemn them, rightfully so we should bear the burden as we currently are as Africans.

It is a fact that at one point or another I may have aspired for the ‘ideal family’ nuclear environment, most likely in the first 10 years of my life because of what happened after proved how flawed the model is. Even with that at the back of my head in the right circumstances and between compatible people I sincerely see the reasoning behind marriage and dare I say I support it? Considering nature saw it fit to prescribe both the male and female as prerequisites for the conception it is only logical that even after birth the offspring gets that support until adulthood at least. The closest thing to a manual any person has ever gotten to how to navigate life was the lessons, discipline and support provided by the parents, marriage facilitates this.

At the end of the day however it would be naive to see marriage as anything other than that, one of the tools which when used ought to create a conducive environment for the child. Ultimately however marriage is a contract. There are other ways to contract, with exactly the same consequences in relation to a child but without the marriage process itself. Considering the likelihood however of this contract collapsing as is currently the trend as reflected in the statistics that show an increase in divorces. It is also no secret that a substantial number of people, especially since the empowerment of the person as an individual rather than the previous focus of only considering the individual as a part of a whole not whole by themselves, voluntarily opt to have their children as single parents. I also can’t be oblivious to death, because as was the case with me and so many others undesirable as it there is always a chance that one of the parents could die.

The nature of human relationships has also evolved so much that managing the relationship with the child needs to be an objective process based on sound principles. In a country that is ravaged by social ills the death of both parents is not uncommon thus necessitating a contract. 

So the important contract that really matters is not the one between the parents, whether they are married or not or the child was conceived as a result an agreement between same sex bisexual parents and a surrogate or a sperm donor ultimately it is how the parties manage their relationship in relation to the child that matters. Considering how unpredictable relationships are and all the variables that could result in the parents separating or dying I argue the most important relationship that should take precedence, even if it is at the expense of the parents feelings should be the contract between the parents and family in relation to their duties and benefits in relation to the child. It also goes without saying that while people often make their decisions based on how they feel, a variable that can change as quickly as the weather or death can come at any time using the relationship between the parents as the basis of their relationship with their child is fundamentally flawed. 

Once a child has been born however they cannot be undone. Irrespective of how you feel towards each other as parents the child you’ve created still needs home and care, food and nurturing as well as support and guidance until at least maturity age. Whether you are single or partnered, married or divorced, straight or gay, once you’ve committed to parenthood it is a permanent responsibility which even your death will not absolve you off. This is because whether you are dead or alive if your child is alive it is in your best interest to plan for your child’s wellbeing if you want them to succeed.

Whether codified or not or given authority as an order court the conception of child creates obligations which need to be discharged. Whether by operation of law or morality the discharge of these benefits can only be managed through a contract. 

One of the key obligations between parents to each other is to keep each other accountable. Unfortunately however the laizers fair manner which we’ve managed parenting as a society has been the opposite of this. Throughout my life I have observed with dismay children suffering the consequences of their parent’s ill-conceived choices and actions. When one party decides to unilaterally undertake commitments which have future consequences without consultation the child is often the one who suffers. So then if one of the of the duties the parents have towards each other in relation to raising a child is to keep each other accountable how then is it possible that the instances of decisions taken unilaterally is such a common occurrence?

For the longest time I believed maybe the justification behind the discrimination was because fathers were so bad at parenting the best of us was still worse than the worst mother. The problem with that narrative however is that I’ve had a father, he was no monster. I’ve seen children being raised by single fathers, more often because the mother had absconded or died because you know, a man is only competent to discharge his parental obligations only if there’s no other option or he is under a woman’s supervision. I believed that maybe there must be something that women do so well compared to us as men, so I set out to find it so that I can be worthy of the privilege of raising my child. The problem however is that to date no one has given me a tangible answer on what this is. 

At first I was convinced that maybe there’s skills that the child passes on during the pregnancy, skills that guarantee the mother will be an expect at parenting 

So if there’s no evidence of biological intervention by the child then surely it is the mother’s domestic prowess. This would make sense because good hygiene and nutrition are prerequisites to anyone’s health, especially children. The problem however is that this definitely is not the case in this instance. It was not enough that I was already proficient in cleaning up after myself and making my own food, just for good measure I actually studied food hygiene in tertiary and practiced it throughout my career as part of my job. So it’s not domestic prowess then, so surely it is one’s socio economic status.

This I can never argue with especially considering I started from very little. Being a pragmatist it’s logical that even before the emotion of fatherhood I would be concerned about the tangible things the child needs to survive and grow to adulthood. 

I know it’s none of these things because factually I do them better in every quantifiable way.

I was fair in the process, I’ve given her 33 months at least to tell me exactly what is this criteria I need to fulfil to prove I am worthy. In this period however nether she nor any legal professional has come out with an objective list of prerequisites. This is even a bigger problem because if there is a competency assessment he needs to pass for him to be with his child, it is my duty to prepare him for that time. 



Chapter 15
Letter to Buggz

From you father and a father figure, to you as a father or a father figure

There reality is I've long had issues with the way we raise kids in the country and the world over but mostly here because that was my experience. The planning before conception to ensure that at least when we opt to have them they come into an environment we would deem suitable, it is after all idiotic and nonsensical to blame someone else who was not party to the decision after the fact.

Like any other person I was hopeful that my son would be born in an ideal environment but I planned for the alternative. I'm now even more grateful, despite the pain, that Buggz birth offered me the opportunity to resolve this problem before it impacted him. Even worse was that the birth of all my kids brought a problem I saw from afar with little immediate consequences on me  home, in my lifetime I'm on the verge of solving most of the problems that plagued my people for generations.

I could have studied this from afar as part of my academic pursuits but somehow I doubt I would have dedicated as much effort. Walking the journey allowed me to propose real solutions so that every man, every woman that has been discriminated against at the expense of their child can pursue justice with no fear.

Unfortunately however I've always had to be cautious in my pursuit to ensure that my focus always remained on the problem and not the person. It is after all my son's mother who represented everything I considered wrong about the current problems plaguing parenting outside of marriage. Whether I like it or preserving her had to be as much of a priority because ultimately the pursuit of justice in the interest of Buggz would be in vain if it case at the expense of half of who he is. To ensure this I deliberately stacked all the odds in her favour while never being vague about my intention for justice. Even before his conception in picking a partner I selected my equal, if age is the most apparent indicator then I made sure we were the same. Everything about her had to place her at an advantage including her background, she needed to have come from an environment that prepared her to be better than me in every way. When she opted to utilize legal representation I not only encouraged the move but had, even before any dispute she to have better legal and social support than I do so I chose an extroverted woman who seemed matured enough by virtue of age and experience. Relationships she thought to have meant the world to me I severed so that such support would instead be in her favour.

By virtue of being an adult she had full capacity to act. At no point did I compel her conceive, I made it her choice. When she told me my presence in her life would lead to your demise I removed myself but always making sure she had all the support I needed to give, within her prescription. Most of all though I gave her time. Time to consider the consequences of her actions on you as the only one who matters.

Unfortunately however justice is my pursuit, because only through justice for all parties can harmony be achieved. I could have taken a step back and be submissive but how would that teach you to stand up for yourself? Letting a problem that is well within my reach remain unsolved would-be cursing you if I anticipated it could affect you in the long run, whether as a father in my position or a member of a family or society with an interest on the future.

I am however grateful for all that has transpired thus  far because it allowed me to know exactly what I'm dealing with in her in relation to you. All the decisions were hers, at no point did I compel her. Unfortunately however those decisions not only put your interests at jeopardy but also hurt my mother, that I can never forgive. That has I turn given me an opportunity to my job as the other parent, keep the other parent accountable in your interest.

I took longer to get to this point because so much of my life required me to redress before I could build even myself, but all that was so you would never had to. I could anticipate failure but that would be my first, because my failure only becomes a reality when I give up. Not out of conformity or tradition but out of your own self-interest for your family, country and the world in whole. Even if I did however this time between yourself and your cousins there's enough people to pursue this cause. Even in the unlikely event you would choose not to follow in my path there's still your cousins. And all of you will have enough to gunner the support you need because my successes and failures will be documented.

I'm fortunate to have had my father prepare me for resilience, even if he opted to do it the hard way through his ultimate sacrifice.

My son is fortunate that he has a father, as I am that I had mine. Just like it was my father’s duty to level the mountains as much as he could so that I wouldn’t have to, even it if came at his expense it is my duty to do the same thing for my son. I hoped for a picket fence, 2,5 children and a wife, just like the fairy tale portrayed in the movies. Fortunately though reality taught me to prepare for the worst, lest the same fate that befell my father befalls me consequently my son. Any challenge my son will have to deal with that ought to have been my battle I prepared to brave it, so that he would not have to. Not that I think even at best he wouldn’t be equipped to conquer the battle, but because I have other wars I’d rather he focus on.

I can never deny that at one point I was sold on the norm, justifiably so because it was all I knew. My parents were married and we were doing relatively well at one point, so was the case with most children who enjoyed the same privilege. 

One of the strategies that have been at the core of this injustice has been society’s bias towards women. Even today it is not uncommon for people to automatically assume the man was at fault in any dispute involving a man and a woman. This bias sadly hasn’t gone unnoticed by the default victims, so much so that those who bear malicious intent have exploited it to their benefit. This bias is so ingrained into us as a norm that we’ve grown blind to its consequences. We know about it because we experience it daily, there’s been numerous studies on it including social experiments like the one BBC UK published on YouTube titled What Happens When A Woman Abuses A Man In Public?. Sometimes I also wonder if I am perpetuating the same with my sisters since I have always felt the need to protect them. Fortunately though they are my siblings, younger siblings to be precise. Any feelings and measures to protect them are justified by the fact that I am their older sibling. 

It also does not help that masculinity has been defined such that men know they can never be victims, it’s just unmanly to admit to a weakness especially relative to a woman. The sight of a man before authorities in the police station seeking redress for being abused by a woman is more likely to seem comedic than serious. The scene from Paradise Stop currently on Netflix 2 minutes in is the best case scenario most men envision should they go and report abuse by a female partner, current or former. What I pictured in my head when I was the subject of a physically abusive women was much worse, an official bursting into laughter while taking my statement. The most reaction I most likely would have gotten from the case would have been a viral clip on social media, more for comedy than anything. To be fair though I also saw a bit of comedy in the reasoning of my ex who thought it was a mature idea to express her satisfaction through physical violence. At most the reasoning was illogical because at the time I was in very good physical condition, at my peak I could bench press double my body weight. Had I retaliated in similar manner her prospects were quite low. What counted to her advantage however was the gender bias, had we fought physically and the case ended in court what were my prospects?  Would it matter that I didn’t start the fight? Fortunately it was my house so I asked her to leave. One of the ways I’ve avoided jail for so long was to know my propensity for violence and manage it, anyone who rubbed me the wrong way would likely bring out the worst in me. So if I am not within the company of those that have that capacity I should be relatively safe. Having your own house where you can invite people is an advantage, when they cease to inspire the good best they go before I turn into my worst version. 

So if I, as a man cannot go to the authorities to seek redress when my rights have been unreasonably contravened where am I supposed to go? If the products of modern civilisation in the form of courts and law enforcement officials cannot offer equal protection in the exercise of their duty as a leviathan how am I to resolve my disputes without resorting to my Hobbesian state of nature? We surrendered our liberties to an authority in hopes that such authourity would exercise the powers we bestowed upon them fairly and in a just manner, what are we to do in this reality as men? Fortunately though this is a reality I prepared for, I knew my prospects were low going in so I prepared myself to stack the odds in my favour. My character would most likely compromise my case so I planned for this eventuality. 

No matter the scenario from as young as I could remember the consequences of not dealing with this inequality have always ended badly for me. At best even if I had achieved matrimonial bliss the odds that would have ended up in a divorce thus putting me back to something I should have dealt with to begin with were high. Even if I had braved my way through a marriage where I am pacified because I know expressing my opinion could cost me my child most likely my offspring would have ended up having to deal with this. In my world that is the very meaning of blasphemy, letting my son deal with what I should have resolved! I would have been burdening him with obligations from the past, in addition to the current ones he’d have to face just to survive let alone thrive before confronting the challenges the future has instore. A reality for most children that share beginnings as humble as mine, amplified in africa but comparable worldwide if circumstances are similar. 

So I planned for it. It was futile to plan for the best, that’s what hope is for. To this day I can still remember the excitement I had when I first heard of women’s right to equality before the law. It was after the women’s conference in Beijing, an event that was often held even in township and rural communities thanks to television.  My interest towards women’s liberation and equal treatment was not so much because I cared for them but mostly for me. For the first time I could find a meaningful and logical way to relate to women, an important thing to a teen who’s hormones are at peak. The whole man being a provider thing had lost its novelty when my father died, whether or not his death was related to the stress of putting food on the table was immaterial, I just knew that’s not how I want to check out. Then there was the whole concept of lobola, somehow  the burden of knowing one day I’d have to pay for the privilege to be with someone I love just never sat right with me. Hopefully equal opportunity to earn would eliminate the burden borne by men to provide which most likely contributed to my father’s early demise. 

Somehow in my teenage brain I reasoned that if men didn’t have an unjustifiable obligation to provide because women could work and earn just as much if not more then I wouldn’t have to face that pressure alone. Worst was that I was living through the consequences of a male favoured workplace and even if I didn’t know whether I’d have a child or not I knew that my reality was not the one my child will have to live through. So just like my approach to feminism was not altruistic then it still isn’t now, I do however believe that equality is not a zero sum game. All parties win, most importantly the child when both mother and father are equal before the law. So since then I have been obsessed with it, so much so I knew I’d need a man to demonstrate the injustice but if I had any chances at finding a willing participant I’d have to be one. Every move I have ever made since this became my reality has been in anticipation of this moment, I did not wish it to be but somehow I knew it was going to happen. Almost like the moment Liam Neeson’s character in Taken tells his daughter that she will be taken, it’s going to happen no matter what!

If not as a single father I most likely would have had to fight for equality as a parent as a divorcee, that is still the best case scenario because if not settled this plague will most likely infect my son. Solo is 10 years now, not long before he will mature sexually and attain adulthood status. If I don’t resolve this the stakes are high, if not for mine’s sake then for them. So considering I already knew my son would be ‘taken’  it was a matter of preparing for it. Most importantly I’d need emotional support, the irony. Fortunately I had my family, I just needed to figure out how to keep it that way and in succeeding my father I did. Sure the choice meant I’d have to work for at least 5 from the start instead of one, a challenge that was not difficult to overcome. Especially because I have the right team, everyone knows their part and they fulfill it!

My son’s mother was perfect when I met her as she is now. That is because the parameters for every woman I have ever dated have always been based on the best interest for my son. At worst condoms break and contraception can fail, whether intentionally or as an authentic oversight. She needed to be able to make it on her own as an independent woman, so that I’d know even if I couldn’t be there she be strong enough more than my mother was. She needed to be able to be my true equal in every sense, someone with a job so she did not depend on me and her own home so that if ever I stepped out of line she’d have an option to leave. My son’s mother has all of these. 

In retrospect I am grateful Buggz was born out of wedlock. This gave me an opportunity to approach this from a worst case scenario, as if my odds as a father to begin with were bad being an unmarried father makes them impossible. But considering this is the default position which any of my children are likely to be in, despite the poor prospects it makes sense to address this problem from this position. Being unmarried also means we can be honest with each other in relation to Buggz as parents without emotions hindering objectivity in our parenting. There is absolutely no risk of either of us letting how we feel about each other interfere with our parenting, as parenting is an objective process. There’s a lot of things that go unsaid when parents put their marriage before the child’s interest. If one party knows objecting against a parenting approach proposed by the other is harmful in the long term to the child but objecting is likely to result in emotional reiteration people tend to accept unsound parenting. Even worse when the marriage benefits one of the parents financially, being objective against the financially strong parent could cost the financially weaker parent the benefits. Eventually parents do not hold each other accountable because such an approach would cost them their partner or provider.

Undesirable as this is however it is understandable, our most basic instinct is after all survival and allegiance to self. So what if we send the child to a school we can't afford in the long term? Our social standing amongst our peers will be elevated in the short term. Nonsensical short term expenditures are not interrogated because people like nice things, so what if we spend the money on a vacation we can't afford instead of investing it towards the child's future? Being unmarried avoids all this. The only thing that unites Buggz's mother and I is our son, this means we have a better opportunity to be honest and hold each other accountable towards delivering on our only objective. The day our romantic relationship failed she ceized to exist as anything other than the mother of my child. No matter how emotionally insensitive she might perceive an approach I propose I don't have to worry I might get kicked out of my own bed for bringing it to the fore. As long as the approach is objective, backed by evidence and is legally sound is all that matters. Fitting too because ultimately should we fail to agree the court will evaluate our case objectively, the intersts of the upper guardian ultimately prioritise the child. This, often inspire of how the parents feel.

While society might still have some fuzzy feelings about marriage the reality is that it is no longer the safe heaven that it used to be in relation to rearing children. The dependency between men and women which was dictated by nature necessitated parents be in a marriage in order to maximize their opportunity to procreate and provide for such offspring. The young men also needed to be pacified because apparently we are wayward and uncontrollable without a woman. In most nguni languages we even have derogatory terms for unmarried man to reinforce their lesser social standing in society. Most religions continue to advocate for marriage so much so that in case of Christianity we even codified this into our law so that we can justify legally discriminating against unmarried individuals. Their offspring especially whom until recently didn't even have the same legal standing before the law as children born within marriages. All these are admirable efforts of social engineering, unfortunately however functional as marriage might have been at some point the ever so increasing divorce rates prove otherwise.

While it might have saved me the headache of going to court to fight for my rights to discharge my obligations to my son marriage would most likely have been bad for me, even worse for Buggz. Looking at only our tax records a union between Buggz's mother and I would have left me at least 50% poorer. All the sacrifices I made and gratification I delayed in my youth to build a stable future for my family, whom my son sits atop would be lost. Ultimately he would have been the biggest loser because when it comes down to it I worked hard so that my son would not have to. If I started from the bottom to get to where I am imagine how far he will get starting from my baseline? A union as a way of avoiding addressing the injustice would have been horrendous for me, worse for Buggz and most likely guaranteed his children will still be suffering the consequences of my inaction.

I am the first to admit at one point I loved the idea of marriage. Unfortunately however what I could never understand was why I should pay for the privilege of being with my equal? If our Union is between two adults who are both capable of earning an income why should I pay? I bought my car, as I did my house, as such they are my possessions thus occupy a lesser status than a person. In a wife however I wanted a partner who is my equal, by its application imposing an unfair obligation to one party implies inequality. If I have to pay the the parents of my wife how is this different from buying her? Surely we have evolved beyond selling people because it is unacceptable and the scars left by history bear testament. Surprisingly however this practice is not only allowed but legislated despite it's implications. Then we wonder why so many children are sold off as brides to their destriment, just so that her parents can benefit. More shocking however is how this practice has prevailed for so long even gaining popularity amongst people of my generation and later.

The justifications are absurd with one popular one claiming it's not payment but thanking the parents of the bride for raising her. It gets even more expensive if she went beyond high school in education because now the groom has to compensate the parents for their expenditure. Why though? Isn't it the parents duty to provide for their child until maturity at least, why should a men have to compensate you for doing your duty? Isn't it obvious that the continued application of this practice reinforces men as superior in the relationship as it implies they should provide, just like their fathers who had to. It doesn't matter now that women can provide for themselves often better than men.

If it is gratitude to the parents for doing an excellent job in raising their child shouldn't then lobola be paid to the parents who did a better job between the two? If we want to justify retaining this practice can we at least ensure we use objective parameters, merit being the best? As luck would have it we can objectively measure the performance of the parents using the child as an indicator. Granted we will need to attribute the child's success to the parents grounding, positive or negative it is the outcome that counts. So with this as the departing point the rest becomes easy. As long as it is the outcome that measured then it should not be a problem to compare the young couple to determine the most successful, one who's parents are worthy of the lobola reward. So whoever is most successful between the two in terms of material possessions, character and most likely to provide positive influence to the couples offspring then becomes the winner. It is after all about the offspring right?

If this was the formula used my mother would be smiling all the way to the bank because she did an excellent job. Despite my efforts to base my relationships on equality I have never found anyone who could match me, even if I discounted the fact that I had to start with a negative and my family in tow. Factually every woman I have ever dated or married has always seen significant improvements in her life just by being with me. That is one of the reasons I have never at any of my ex's houses, even when they had them. Moving to my house always sold itslef as a better option because my home is that good. Even the cottages which are only a sample of the whole often are better than what most people can afford. I take pride in this because I have worked hard to get here and continue to do so to remain here. 

So even if there was a case for marriage we've ruined it by using it for personal benefit often at the expense of the child. The same applies to the practice of 'damages', thankfully it is a directory provision so there is hope it'll eventually due. It is just as derogatory as lobola and has exactly the same connotations. Maybe when an adult male and minor female had gotten pregnant there was justification for it's practice. I'm not sure how this would work though in South Africa today because sexual intercourse with a minor is a crime. Be that as it may at some point it did make sense to burden the man with the expenses, again because he was privileged to be in an income earning capacity while she was not allowed to go to work. It made sense the parents would go and seek redress because the minor child is after all still under their care, until maturity at least. How then is there any justification to pursue this practice if the parties are both adults? Surely by the time one gets past 18 to 21 they are competent enough to contract in their capacity with no parental intervention. Unless offcourse this is another reward that accrues to the parent for doing their job, in hopes that it is used to the interests of the minor child which I doubt is the case. I have not evidence of this being the case in my experience.

Enforcement of the maternal preference rule in morden day South Africa or any democratic country for that matter that is based on equality is questionable enough but even more concerning is the lengths to which it's proponents will go to ensure it's prevalence. I do pride myself as a law abiding citizen, it is a trait I learned from my parents and continue to practice. I can't be a criminal and expect to live in a crime free society, at best my son needs a role model and we have enough young black men in jail. Imagine having to stand before a magistrate to defend an allegation of domestic violence against Buggz's mother and Buggz. No matter how much I tried to reason otherwise other than malice I could not find any other reason for the allegation. The irony is that the allegation was intending to keep me from a place I did not want to go to at first.

After Buggz was born I asked Buggz's mother to decide when and where I see him, at least until for parenting plan was in place. In such approach I hoped for reasonableness and even if the arrangements were not to my liking I grit my teath just to be with Buggz. It was no secrete I never liked both her house and the neighborhood it is in, somehow it reminds me of a township. One of my most traumatic experiences in my life happened in a township, en route from getting some much needed food items I got robbed. Then next day I had to walk from Mbalenhle to Secunda to get money. Which I didn't get, so I had to walk back. Any place that reminds me of that I'd rather not go, and I didn't even during the subsistence of our relationship. The first time we met she came to my house, the fact is if our relationship was dependent on me going to her house there wouldn't have been a relationship. So I've always been clear of my reservations of her place but when she insisted that's the only way I'd see Buggz I complied. Now the allegation just added insult to injury because it's not enough that I have to see my son in a place I hate, now I'm being barred from going to a place I never wanted to be in to begin with?

Fortunately this was a tactic I predicted, thus prepared for. Saddening as it is that one would report to lying to retain an unjustifiable position even worse is that this tactic often succeeds. How could it not? Society wants to protect women. Men are deemed to the Satan if ever there was such a thing. Even better is that we as men know this, so often we won't defend the allegations since the outcome is often predetermined. I remember the gentleman who served me. Apart from the obvious concern and twitchiness in his expression after I offered him coffee and calmed him he offered some advice to me. He almost begged me to defend the allegation because it had been his experience that most some men don't. If not because of financial restrictions or knowing you are going to be defending yourself not only against your acvuser but the magistrate as well. He didn't take my coffee as he had other people to serve but I took his advice, not that I ever intended not to. I'd swear the way this man was so twitchy it was almost comical, at one point he asked if I had dogs which I do. I could tell that through experience he must have had a running with someone who didn't want to be served and had dogs, fortunately I do not shoot the messenger. More than anything I admire anyone who does what it takes to provide for themselves and their families. 

With all that however whenever she had to chose between being in her house and mine it was always the latter, as long as the conditions were conducive to that arrangement. In retrospect this is now to my advantage, because she can never claim my home was unsuitable for our child. It is one thing that other children thrive in my home but she has personal experience. From my Bassonia unit which she promptly moved into with me to my current home which was an upgrade from that, even when our emotional relationship ended a portion of my home was still better than hers. While I always had my reservations against her house during the subsistence of our relationship I have never expressed any objections against it being my son’s home. Admittedly I have a certain taste in my homes which, even though inconsistent with her’s it good enough that she’d live it while I would never live hers. Vanity was never enough on my part to want to question her ability to provide a suitable home for our son, she’s lived my life and all evidence suggests given the chance she still would want to live it. So what is the justification to not want Buggz to enjoy as much of his other home as he does hers?

The ease with which we side with women hasn’t gone unnoticed as well because every woman knows this. This knowledge means power, allege wrongdoing against a man and the prospects of success are high no matter how weak the case is. In my case, even if there is no case! I have never been abusive to Buggz’s mother, even if I wanted to I couldn’t have because I made sure of this. We are equals, even if you use age as a measure she will have the advantage. Even when she stayed in my house she had the option of leaving and going back to her house. I have always been objective in my approach, my commitment to transparency and external evaluation if needed I further reinforced when I reduced all our communication to writing in relation to Buggz. Admittedly my directness has often been misinterpreted as offensive but when it was evaluated for abusiveness as the restraining order implied I was not found wanting. My directness was to be expected in relation to my son because even during the subsistence of the relationship I was the same. There was an attempt from my side to ensure objective equality between us, when the time came I insisted on a prenuptial contract to ensure that we would always be aware ours was an objective union rather than romantic.

Dig deeper and it becomes apparent that these are a consequence of political rhetoric that has plundered the country to further segregation. That's quite strange because to the world our Constitution has been hailed as amongst the best; upholding justice, prevailing rule of law and human rights to mention a few are amongst the basic human rights.
______________________________________________________________

Meanwhile in the West their child continues to define my future. Despite emotional and sentimental attachment to the ways of yore, everything that is relevant to my life is no product of my own. The East, in cases of those that were once where were are is catching up if not done already, so once again your reality is still not a product of your own. The house I  live in was engineered from the West and it is powered by technology from the East. This is my reality. The curiosity to query the reason behind and the factors that contribute to Africa lagging behind through its children was always bound to have me asking the questions.

I can however not discount the power of negative reinforcement because through not knowing what not to do, as proven by most of my people today I at least had an advantage. By opting to tread the path less travelled, often at loggerheads with the sense of what ought to define me, I am prevailing. My family is prevailing. My country and continent as well must also prevail so that we can participate on equal bases with the rest of the world.

The experience I went through of losing my father and having to help my mother to a point of leadership inspired this journey. My baby will be a baby when he is one, because I expect nothing less of an adult when the time comes. This meant I had to define the stereotype and buck the trend.
