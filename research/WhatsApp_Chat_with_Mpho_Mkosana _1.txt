2016/12/07, 2:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: At least I've been
2016/12/07, 2:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's done nothing
2016/12/07, 2:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: All u have said in your talk and promises u threw out the window
2016/12/07, 2:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: We can't can't call ourselves smart people and keep doing the same thing when it's clearly not working
2016/12/07, 2:12 PM - Mpho Mkosana: U have to understand I'm not going to the psychologist in the hope she will 'fix us'
2016/12/07, 2:12 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I think we could go either way at this point
2016/12/07, 2:30 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's where we differ. 

I have specified clearly what results in situations getting out of hand, a psychologist will do nothing to help you choose whether or not you will clean up after yourself.

U get surprised that when something is extreme I react in an extreme manner but when I have a problem I remove it, case in point Tina stayed with me when she became a problem I told her to leave; same goes for Unathi.

In your case when I say leave it's not to be spiteful. I have certain things I want done in a certain way, I'll do what I can to accommodate U but there's a limit. 

U crossed it so when U do its a sign you'd rather be in your house, I can't hold you to a 'promise' when you're miserable with my approach and I am with yours.
2016/12/07, 2:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Once again our relationship is all about u and your needs
2016/12/07, 2:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: A psychologist would tell us that the reason why I'm so against cleaning up after anyone is because there's a time when despite not having caused the mess I had to clean it up.

Not again.
2016/12/07, 2:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If you were more self critical this would be easier
2016/12/07, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But in your mind you are perfect
2016/12/07, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And clearly can't be taught anything
2016/12/07, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Not said in a mean way
2016/12/07, 2:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2016/12/07, 2:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Lets stop going in circles like Skhokho chasing his tail
2016/12/07, 2:35 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That is why Mpho I say I understand you are not happy with my approach, you don't have to subject yourself to it.

If I'm imperfect you don't have to be subjected to that.

What I am as a product of careful planning and sacrifices, where I am I planned to be. There is no way what I will give up the simple needs I've worked so hard to achieve.
2016/12/07, 2:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2016/12/07, 2:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I get it, there's no meeting of half way. There's your way or no way.
2016/12/07, 2:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If your idea of meeting you halfway is you causing a mess and me cleaning it up definitely no.
2016/12/07, 2:44 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I said this before and I will again, your actions are guided by emotion and I'm a pragmatist.

When my father died I cried but tears didn't provide for my family, I could have felt pity about my circumstances but that too didn't change them.

So as a pragmatist I worked hard, I studied when most were partying and I planned while my peers played. 

That worked for me and I've no reason to change it.
2016/12/08, 12:06 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: My apologies for some what making you think I'm more than what I am.

Salatiso is Salatiso, I make no apologies for me. In my life everyone exists within the context of me.
2016/12/08, 12:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: You're better, 

You're greater,

Be better and be greater.
2016/12/08, 12:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: You're all U need to be.
2016/12/08, 12:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: As am I.
2016/12/08, 12:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I never said you need me to be
2016/12/08, 12:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Thought we were partners
2016/12/08, 12:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But it seems I'm fighting for your time with the rest of everyone in your life
2016/12/08, 12:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Being partners means being complementary
2016/12/08, 12:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Before I met you I knew I would.....

Hence I'll willingly U support you to take a decision I took when I was in my early 20's...   ..

Finish my degree
2016/12/08, 12:15 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I sacrificed so I could ..   .....
2016/12/08, 12:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's why U can confidently say if I had the means and u Salatiso would hg have to be a stay home dad... 


And I'd be....

Because I worked hard.  So I don't have to. ..
2016/12/08, 12:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: But cleaning up after yourself will always remain a prerequisite.....
2016/12/09, 12:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I will go to the shrink, 

But I will not pay.
2016/12/09, 12:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok, 1pm

2017/01/19, 11:28 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: CAR THIEVES GONE DIGITAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Forwarded as received 

"I locked my car. As I walked away I heard my car door unlock''.
I went back and locked my car again three times.

Each time, as soon as I started to walk away, I could hear it unlock again!! Naturally alarmed, I looked around and there were two men sitting in a car next to the Store.

They were obviously watching me intently, and there seemed no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation.

I quickly abandoned my errand, jumped into my car and sped away.

I went straight to the police station, told them what had happened, and found out I was part of a new, and very successful, scheme being used to gain entry into parked cars.

Two weeks later, my friend's son had a similar experience....While traveling, he stopped at a motorway service area to use the toilet.

When he came out to his car less than 5 minutes later, someone had managed to get into his car and had stolen his mobile phone, laptop computer, sat-nav, briefcase and other belongings.

He called the police and since there were no signs of his car having been broken into, the police told him he had probably been a victim of the latest robbery tactic – there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your remote locking device.

They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. They know you are going inside the Store, restaurant, or whatever and that they now have a few minutes to steal and run.

* The police officer said always to lock your car manually with the key when parking in a public area. That way if there is someone sitting in a car nearby watching for their next victim, it will not be you.

When you lock up with the key upon exiting, it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the remote button, it sends the code through the airwaves where it can be easily intercepted by the device.

This is very real. Be aware of what you just read and please pass this information on.

Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remote just to be sure we remembered to lock them -- and bingo, someone has our code...and potentially whatever is in our car."

Please share with everyone you know in the hope that we can frustrate these thieves.

2017/01/20, 4:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You're splitting it because you're talking to 2 audiences...

You're simplifying for the user...

You're optimising for the service provider....
2017/01/20, 4:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Are you home?
2017/01/20, 4:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes
2017/01/20, 4:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I get it
2017/01/20, 4:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But aesthetics count
2017/01/20, 4:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Second option would be to put the first part on top of pigee

Then the second part on top of back (between pigee & back)

He's revised the script and shorted the video.

You can handle him going forward.

You need to approve the revision or edit so he can start the animation.

2017/01/25, 2:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I would love to know the angle he has on this training.

I think he's using it to syphon money out of the skills levy.

It's just too good a gesture to come from him
2017/01/25, 3:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/01/25, 3:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The wife's department gets paid for it

2017/01/31, 10:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can't she rent a storage unit?

I will offer to pay for it for 6 months @ R480

All she'd have to do is arrange for transport but most of them offer that service too at a nominal cost.
2017/01/31, 10:40 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's not about storing it for the next 6 months it's the fact that she can't do it anytime this week
2017/01/31, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will still move out this weekend
2017/01/31, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I would just have to come back for big stuff and remainder of goods next

2017/02/02, 4:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I could have done that
2017/02/02, 4:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's not well done
2017/02/02, 4:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Why didn't you do it?

I found out yesterday that the animator hadn't done any work since the weekend because he is waiting for the voice.
2017/02/02, 4:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Thought we had agreed you would
2017/02/02, 4:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: There was no agreement
2017/02/02, 4:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: After which you locked yourself in the study and practiced
2017/02/02, 4:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: All I know is the project is not moving
2017/02/02, 4:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: An unnecessary delay I can't afford
2017/02/02, 4:12 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But you had said to him he must do animation and you would rate him
2017/02/02, 4:12 PM - Mpho Mkosana: He said nothing about waiting for voice over
2017/02/02, 4:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Are you happy with that voice over?
2017/02/02, 4:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

2017/02/02, 4:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I need a voice

This is good enough.
2017/02/02, 4:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So do you want to make it work with these people seeing as you have already hired them?
2017/02/02, 4:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/02/02, 4:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I want the project to be completed, I don't care about the how.

If you can do the voice do it, I'm only interested in progress.
2017/02/02, 6:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What's your computer code?
2017/02/03, 8:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: One day only has very nice cat boots for about R800 if you're interested

2017/02/06, 2:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What do u mean u can't interpret?
2017/02/06, 2:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: On the last one I can see property which will be the long term investment tool of the entity,

An arrow for Salatiso

The i in investment is the innovative/ online/ connected/ future
2017/02/06, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Even the triangular shape is a symbol of strength since triangles are amongst the strongest shapes
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Same as the 2nd though
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It looks like a building
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Gold is Gold!
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Arrow direction
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So it serves 2 things;
- Symbolises property which is one of the most trusted Investments of all time,
- Strength and stability
2017/02/06, 2:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The colour can be gold
2017/02/06, 2:39 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes this one!
2017/02/06, 2:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I told them to play around from black and red which are too dominant to gold

2017/02/06, 2:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Building
2017/02/06, 2:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And it has an arrow
2017/02/06, 2:43 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And it's sophisticated
2017/02/06, 3:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mmmhhhhhhh

2017/02/06, 5:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Meant to say "Better to get the date wrong one day early than to miss a class and be one day late"
2017/02/06, 5:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I get you what I'm asking you do you want to go get your food now

2017/02/07, 2:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: eBooks are normally cheaper than Paper Backs
2017/02/07, 2:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Someone told me about an online book place that gives you free text box but they ask me to put in credit card details which is making me nervous
2017/02/07, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Be cautioned though,

Might be cheap but they are cumbersome to use.
2017/02/07, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Don't know it

2017/02/07, 5:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't understand how after the furor and annoyance you know I have with the pantry door you still don't close it.

Completely baffles me.

Rather stop accessing the pantry, I'll feed my dogs.

Effective immediately.
2017/02/07, 5:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Unfocused morning, sorry
2017/02/07, 5:07 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said I'll feed the dogs,

All they have to do is just switch from people to packages....

2017/02/22, 9:28 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's dreary, 

Worst is grey complements nothing in the house.

A colour or pattern would have been better as an alternative to my colour because at least it would have created a focal point.

This is just bland
2017/02/22, 9:28 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I hope it looks better in person.

2017/03/02, 11:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If your work makes your want to take a flask to start your day ...... Quit. Walk to your boss, hand your resignation and I'll have your back.
2017/03/02, 11:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Only thing I wish you'd understand is the blindsight theory, I'm good with foresight. I'll never agree to you diggging yourself into a deeper financial hole with a new fancy (shitty) 1 serious while you're not happy with what finances it which also forces you to endure the job you can't.

If one day you came to me and said you can't stand your boss a.K.a. the dick and you want to quit I'd plan your exit with you.

But it would be predicated you trusting me with logic as follows;
- Let all your house out so it pays for itself.
- Reduce your liabilities (a.k.a. Instalments) so you can live off nothing,
- A 50 k payoff for an old mini is cheaper than paying off a new 1 serious (capital debt)
2017/03/02, 11:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Between me and you understand our strengths and weaknesses;
- I can endure, I'm used to coping, can you?
- So if you can't do you understand that relationship s mean carrying your partner / spouse when the can't or where they lack?
2017/03/03, 12:11 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'd carry you where you can't or lack should one day you come and say you've parted ways with Frans a.K.a the prick. 

I'm not the question but the default; the question is can you carry yourself?

 Will you understand when I'm fussy about something your consider small?

You say you'll be with me when I'm poor; I'd never have to be, if you'd never let me down with what you think little but I value as the highest.

Mpho; as my partner it means blind trust. I'm good with logic let me deal with that but that means you deal with something else.

I can't worry about you being taken care of (while pregnant) and a door being closed cos I'm under pressure and small things irk me.

In this house I invest so ;
- You have a home
- You have a functional home

I don't like who I am but who Salatiso is is necessary.

#Trust
2017/03/03, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I appreciate all that you have said above
2017/03/03, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I really do
2017/03/03, 10:32 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I used to have blind trust in you Salatiso but that lead me to being thrown out of what was 'my safe haven' your home. I still kept trusting maybe not as blindly and there were repeats and no apologies.
2017/03/03, 10:33 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso in many ways is what he chooses to be. There are near non changeables I agree

2017/03/03, 10:35 AM - Mpho Mkosana: When u have a chance watch this
2017/03/03, 10:35 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It talks of habits we allow in our lives
2017/03/03, 10:43 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I am practical in my approach, you have a practical problem I'm offering a practical solution.

What I am is who I need to be, there is no one that will give me an idealist way I need to adopt. Until the practical problem my practical approach is directed towards is solved I will not change my approach.
2017/03/03, 10:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I disagree, who you are is who you choose to be
2017/03/03, 10:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I have never said change who u fundamentally are
2017/03/03, 10:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: There are things about u that annoy me but I can put up with
2017/03/03, 10:50 AM - Mpho Mkosana: The moods
2017/03/03, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Your feeling the need to be singular and not part of relationship
2017/03/03, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That also actually has you acting as such in some things as a result
2017/03/03, 10:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: These things are hurtful and annoying at times but do not take a stab at my being
2017/03/03, 10:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not feeling safe in ur home cause I might get kicked out does
2017/03/03, 10:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Feeling anxious every time I see you have messaged me - does
2017/03/03, 10:54 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Your job could be a problem but until you can factually quantity its benefits vs impacts you can't make an informed decision.

You earn an amount which you direct towards your expenses. Of those expenses which do you need and which can you do away with. Then you can quantify, make provisions or compromises to plug the gap then decide. 

Quitting your job as an eventuality might be new to you but I anticipated it a long time ago. It's for this reason that I've tried to assist you to reduce your liabilities so should you decide you can survive with minimal inconvenience. These include;
- Renting out your room to increase your income,
- Getting rid of your credit card debt,
- Not replacing Macy,
- Not creating a new debt in for form of a Suzuki Jimny or of lately BMW 1 series.

All that even though you probably didn't see it or agree with my approach was meant to help you; does not benefit me directly at all.
2017/03/03, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I get what ure saying with BMW Salatiso
2017/03/03, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hence I spoke to u about it
2017/03/03, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Your approach was not the best
2017/03/03, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Made me feel like I take full interest in your stuff but you don't mine
2017/03/03, 10:56 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: When I say you should move out it is a practical approach to a problem.

If you are not happy and I am not the only logical solution is the hardest.
2017/03/03, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But I got it
2017/03/03, 10:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/03/03, 10:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I disagree
2017/03/03, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Practical approach when you are in a committed relationship is to tackle problem at hand
2017/03/03, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Give and take
2017/03/03, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Compromise
2017/03/03, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Throwing me out(and I don't mean this in a mean way) is exhibiting childish behaviours ie chucking toys, giving up, defeatist
2017/03/03, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And once again the issue u choose to not a address
2017/03/03, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I never apologise
2017/03/03, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: *u
2017/03/03, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: When we fight you attack me alot
2017/03/03, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not the problem
2017/03/03, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I've said this to you before that you are not invested in me and it comes up in multiple little things but I think my aahhhaa moment was when you said your sister should not marry Arthur unless he sees a psycholgist about the issues he has with his family and I turned to you and I said you're being hypocritical because you would not do the same but I've since then come to realise that because you have not 100% invested in me you giving the best of you- to me -is not important to you. Cause you are still operating on how I fit in your life to the point of not disrupting your 'comfortable' life too much. It can a bit but not too much. To the point where you are not willing to see how much I have bent over dbl to make you happy.
2017/03/03, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And still see fault - constantly
2017/03/03, 11:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm 100% invested - have been for ages and have professed it over and over
2017/03/03, 11:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I am not perfect
2017/03/03, 11:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But I keep trying
2017/03/03, 11:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Even though I know you will criticize even that
2017/03/03, 11:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

We've been together for more than 2 year. By now there's certain things that should be working, the building blocks @ least.

Those things don't work. The only thing we do together that's practical is that we sleep in the same bed, other than that whatever is working is haphazard. 

You're a talker, I'm a doer. If I want something I take tangible steps to do it, it gets done. This works for me. If talking works for you that's fine but so far it has yielded very little with me.

I am not Atha. The reason going to a psychologist would work for his is based on my understanding of his character, one size does not fit all.

You want me to apologise yet I tell you I won't do something for the sake of doing it. If I don't apologize it means I don't see anything worth apologising for.

In my life I've been forced to learn that sometimes a hard option might not be nice to take but if not taken you're in a worse place tomorrow. My life is a testament of hard decisions which have been taken and have yielded the desired results.

You say the other day if I make a fuss about an open door how could we cope we 'real' things like loosing a child that couples go through. What you forget is that the door is real and now for me, talking about something that might or might not happen is immaterial. 

If I cannot trust you with little physical things like closing a door what makes you think we'll get to a point where our relationship will progress to loosing a child being a possiblity?
2017/03/03, 11:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So you are say of all the things you have said and done in our relationship you have nothing to apologise for?
2017/03/03, 11:38 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Once again not sarcastically - you are perfect in our relationship?
2017/03/03, 11:38 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And in my being a speaker not a do - I did not improve in keeping your house clean?
2017/03/03, 11:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you see what I mean re you choose not to see any of my efforts?
2017/03/03, 11:48 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And yes I like planning and may not be as great with implementation and u good with action but the 2 work hand in hand
2017/03/03, 11:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hence I miss a lot of your action and misunderstand it cause you don't communicate
2017/03/03, 11:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I really think it's sad that you don't see anything with us that works
2017/03/03, 11:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Do we need to fine tune and learn to do certain things better for each other - most definitely. Which requires communication.
2017/03/03, 11:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And as I said about the door if it was that NB to u u would have put in arm - that would have been you working with me, being strong where I am clearly weak - not what you did do which is point out my weakness over and over and make me feel useless
2017/03/03, 12:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did I make an effort to keep the door closed - YES. Did that matter to your controlling tendency self - NO
2017/03/03, 12:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The door is not a fundamental Salatiso no matter how much you try to make it one
2017/03/03, 12:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Question is... would I try with something that's not a strong point to me to be what I need to be at any juncture?
2017/03/03, 12:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Answer is YES
2017/03/03, 12:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will it be enough for you that I try and not perfect? Answer is clearly no cause my efforts are never enough for u.
2017/03/03, 12:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And you insisting I just do it confers with the fact that you are trying to make me you.
2017/03/03, 12:41 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Right and wrong is relative.

When I say or do something it is the most appropriate thing to be said or done at that moment.

If later some information surfaces contradicting my statement or action I will apologise or correct my action.

If I haven't apologised for something it's because there's no new information that has surfaced to show I was wrong.

So if I have either said or done something and haven't apologised for it means I feel it is not apology worthy and I still believe my statement and action to be correct.
2017/03/03, 2:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If you can't apologise and be flexible with your partner tho  And want peace....
2017/03/03, 2:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Going past veg fruit place
2017/03/03, 2:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Want anything?
2017/03/03, 2:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: When right words are used or misused they loose their meaning.

Just like I choose when to profess my love I am just as pedantic about 'sorry'.

An apology is more than anything an acknowledgement of wrong doing, a promise not to repeat and a tool to soothe.

I will not say it when I don't mean it.
2017/03/03, 2:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Onion, tomato
2017/03/03, 2:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Which I guess explains why you never apologize cause u have every intention of doing it again
2017/03/03, 2:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Honestly I don't know why we're still doing this, it's pointless and exhausting.

If there's a problem logic dictates efforts must be directed at solving it. At some point however an acknowledgement must be made if a problem can't be solved.

Personally, I think we tried and we failed. I am ready to down my tools, we tried we failed. 

We don't work.
2017/03/03, 2:43 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/03/03, 2:43 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How do you suggest we go  forward?
2017/03/03, 3:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I mean it in the sense of I don't have a place at my house now and I'm studying which makes it difficult to try and squat at people's houses
2017/03/03, 3:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't know Mpho.

All I know is I'm exhausted. I don't know what an ideal relationship looks like. What I know is if this is it then I'm guaranteed a quick miserable death should I continue with it.
2017/03/04, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Do u want croissants or scone
2017/03/04, 10:36 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Want, yes.

But I can't eat them so no.
2017/03/04, 10:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Y?
2017/03/04, 10:41 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Refined carbs
2017/03/04, 2:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: A lovely little girl was holding two apples with both hands.

Her mum came in and softly asked her little daughter with a smile; my sweetie, could you give your mum one of your two apples?

The girl looked up at her mum for some seconds, then she suddenly took a quick bite on one apple, and then quickly on the other.

The mum felt the smile on her face freeze. She tried hard not to reveal her disappointment.

Then the little girl handed one of her bitten apples to her mum,and said: mummy, here you are. This is the sweeter one.

No matter who you are, how experienced you are, and how knowledgeable you think you are, always delay judgement.  

Give others the privilege to explain themselves.    
                            
What you see may not be the reality. Never conclude for others.

Which is why we should never only focus on the surface and judge others without understanding them first.

Those who like to pay the bill, do so not because they are loaded but because they value friendship above money.

Those who take the initiative at work, do so not because they are stupid but because they understand the concept of responsibility.

Those who apologize first after a fight, do so not because they are wrong but because they value the people around them.

Those who are willing to help you, do so not because they owe you any thing but because they see you as a true friend.

Those who often text you, do so not because they have nothing better to do but because you are in their heart.

Those who take out time to chat with you, do not mean they are jobless or less busy, but they know the importance of keeping in touch.

One day, all of us will get  separated  from each other; we will miss our conversations of everything & nothing; the dreams that we had. 

Days will pass by, months, years, until this contact becomes rare... One day our children will see our pictures and ask 'Who are these people?' And we will smile with invisible tears  because a heart is touched with a strong word and you will say: 'IT WAS THEM THAT I HAD THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE WITH'.

Send this to all your friends that you will never forget. 

Put this on the whatsapp of those who made you smile in any type of way. 

It might surprise you but look at how many will be sent back.

Thank you for making me smile for sometime in my life.
2017/03/04, 2:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please take my card and buy 3 stain resistant mats, builders or game sell them.
2017/03/04, 2:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mats to wipe feet when coming from outside.

2017/03/04, 6:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not me,

The installer, maybe the message got lost in translation.

The day he came I only told him of the dimensions. Not colour.

THE GREENLAND OF LOVE
P.O. BOX Hot kisses
VIA ROMANCE
5 March 1986

Dear Sugar,

Time and ability plus double capacity has forced my pen to dance automatically on this benedicted sheet of paper. Why this miraculous thing happened is because honey I love you spontaneously and as I stand horizontal to the
wall and perpendicular to the ground I only think of you, since you are a fantastic and fabulous girl. My Darling please Stop haranguing with the feelings in my heart because I love you more than a snake loves rat. To me each day starts by thinking of you and ends by dreaming of you. Each time I see you my metabolism suddenly stops and my peristalsis goes in reverse gear. My medulla oblongata also stops functioning.
Crazy crazy crazy you may say but this is true. If only you knew what is going on in my encephalon you would understand.. That's why I need to see you face to face soon. I think I have to pen-off here because I still haven't finished studying electrolysis and polymerization. Catch you later.
Sleep tight and don't let those bed bugs bite you because you are too sweet for them.

Yourz forever

In Love

2017/03/15, 8:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hectic traffic on Kliprivier if you leave in the next 30 use ternative route

2017/03/15, 6:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Source from an employee at Home Affairs- Security Alert: Be warned, there is a group going to homes and pretending to be officials from home affairs. They have documents with the letterhead Department of Home Affairs and claim to be confirming that everyone has a valid ID for the upcoming elections. They are robbing homes. Take note there is no initiative like that from the government. Send this on your neighborhood group chat. They are everywhere and they look presentable
2017/03/16, 7:37 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Where's your car keys?

2017/03/23, 6:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/03/23, 6:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mhhhh

I wonder why
2017/03/23, 6:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Even more concerning is that he didn't tell me this
2017/03/23, 6:25 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The vet says there's no over the counter medication for pain, she'll have to come in for a consultation.
2017/03/24, 8:34 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

There's a shredded book in the driveway.

Most likely shredded when you can in yesterday,

Question is why didn't you at least pick up the debris?
2017/03/24, 8:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Didn't see a shredded book
2017/03/24, 8:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Why is there a book in the driveway??
2017/03/24, 8:52 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It was dark when I came home ie I would not see a book in the drive way as we have no light
2017/03/24, 8:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My point of vision in the morning does not include seeing debris in the drive way
2017/03/24, 8:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And my line of vision is concentrated on 1. Seeing cars coming up and down the road 2. Is the garage closed 3. Is the gate closed
2017/03/24, 8:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I doubt I shredded it I would have felt my wheels slip if I shredded a book
2017/03/24, 8:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I did not slip on the driveway
2017/03/24, 8:56 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: SMH
2017/03/24, 9:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Wow, so I'm lying?

Do you want to come?
2017/04/01, 3:43 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You want me to get Miller on the way back?

Please lower volume
2017/04/03, 9:25 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please check if those crutches are consistent with the ones they aim to replace, if not I'll look for another set
2017/04/03, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: They are different
2017/04/03, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Should I have a chat with your sister?
2017/04/03, 9:31 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: You can
2017/04/03, 9:34 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Seeing the owner of these things has been waiting in excess of a year can't they just take what is there, you can get an apology 'gift' for the inconvenience.

This is an inconvenience I don't need
2017/04/03, 9:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No Comment
2017/04/03, 9:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: If you want I will personally deliver the crutches, I will take full ownership and make amends for my misdemeanour.
2017/04/03, 9:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I will be swapping the couches this week, Heti will take your couch to Melville and take mine to the workshop.

I'd like him to do it while Msitheli is there assuming he's got access to the house.

Alternatively you can give me a contact person who will give him access.
2017/04/03, 9:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/03, 9:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Tell me which day and time
2017/04/03, 10:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Today

The guy will probably be in Melville around 17:30
2017/04/03, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: If he goes earlier Delights there till 4
2017/04/03, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Which would be a lot easier
2017/04/03, 10:54 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: He can't go earlier because he needs to start by the house for your couch.

Traffic and all factored 17:30 is a safe bet.
2017/04/03, 11:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/03, 4:08 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please cancel arrangements you might have made

Heti couldn't get the big bakkie
2017/04/03, 4:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/04, 7:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/04/04, 8:12 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

This thing that we are doing I can't do it anymore.

Please start the process to move back to your house.

This is unhealthy.
2017/04/04, 8:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso, you know I can't just move to my house
2017/04/04, 8:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I have 1 year leases in place
2017/04/04, 8:15 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Leases have exit clauses,

Either party is allowed to give a notice if there's justifiable grounds.

I am not going to do this for a year.

From our last fight i thought i made it clear that we're not working, a relationship died and now it's rotting.

You need to actively assist your tenant to move out.
2017/04/04, 8:15 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't know what to tell you other than that
2017/04/04, 8:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And from our last fight and when we chatted last week in bed I said there are core issues wrong with you and me that need to be worked out
2017/04/04, 8:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And us 'seeing' is not going to fix it
2017/04/04, 8:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Work needs to be put in - but you were not willing. Which is your choice
2017/04/04, 8:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But I had also said when I was about to leave earlier this year are you sure about me staying
2017/04/04, 8:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I asked you are u sure
2017/04/04, 8:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Twice
2017/04/04, 8:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Cause if I don't leave now I have no where to go
2017/04/04, 8:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U said stay
2017/04/04, 8:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U Salatiso
2017/04/04, 8:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I did not force it out t you
2017/04/04, 8:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So we are going to have to come up with a different solution than me kicking someone out - cause you were very much part of the  decision of me staying
2017/04/04, 8:23 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I have a test tonight, we can chat about this further tonight when I'm back
2017/04/04, 8:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And can I remind you that when you suggested I give up my room you said you would never kick me out should this occur.
2017/04/04, 9:02 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I told you I conceded to you staying because your 'parting' monologue was exhausting.
2017/04/04, 9:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Now ure being mean to shut me up
2017/04/04, 9:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And telling half truths
2017/04/04, 9:04 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Go to your tenant, tell them they need to look for a place.

Because this is an inconvenience to them i am willing to pay for the transport to move them.

If they find a place that's more expensive I'm willing assist with the shortfall.

Heck I'm even willing to swop and have your tenant on my cottages.
2017/04/04, 9:05 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: The point is this can be done,

The only issue is how much it will cost me.

I am willing to pay.
2017/04/04, 9:06 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No one wants to move to the South
2017/04/04, 9:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Of all those options you choose to see the one that's not possible, your thought process fascinates me.
2017/04/04, 9:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm just stating the truth
2017/04/04, 9:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: All i know is I cannot live like this and it's best to resolve it while I'm still rational, because I will loose it.

Make it happen.

If you think there's an us to be saved you can do it from your house
2017/04/04, 9:09 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just make it happen

2017/04/04, 9:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So you are willing to pay for me to stay there for a year
2017/04/04, 9:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm willing to save my sanity no matter the cost
2017/04/04, 9:14 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm driving you insane?
2017/04/04, 9:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: This thing we are doing is driving me insane
2017/04/04, 9:14 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My presence?
2017/04/04, 9:15 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Wow
2017/04/04, 9:16 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Anything i cannot qualify is enough to drive me mad.

What are we? 

The only thing we do together is sleep on different sides of the same bed.

What the hell is that kind of relationship?
2017/04/04, 9:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So

Rather than be faced with something i don't understand I'm much happy alone 

Because that i understand
2017/04/04, 9:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: We are a couple that is not working through things that are Beneath the surface
2017/04/04, 9:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: We are a couple that is self destructing as a result of that
2017/04/04, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I said this early in our relationship you have a tendency to sabotage things that seem too good
2017/04/04, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hence you had to make issues
2017/04/04, 9:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I even said Once the kitchen door starts being close you will find something else
2017/04/04, 9:24 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Give it names point fingers and do whatever you want.

All i know is this doesn't work for me.

I will not find myself hating my home because i know each time i go there i will be faced with this thing.

You have options, you have friends to go to heck even a house.

I don't, I hate people and my house is my centre. When that is gone so is my sanity.

As you once correctly said i spend my money on things i value the most. Since you've met me 80% of my expenditure has gone to my home.... Because it means that much
2017/04/04, 9:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not pointing fingers Salatiso
2017/04/04, 9:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm trying to be rational
2017/04/04, 9:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: This whole situation is being made to satisfy you and your desires
2017/04/04, 9:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Only
2017/04/04, 9:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I must inconvenience someone by kicking them out mid lease and probably be taken to Housing tribunal
2017/04/04, 9:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Uproot myself - which would have been easier last year - but I'm studying now
2017/04/04, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's a Huge inconvenience for me
2017/04/04, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And my friends have their lives - I was going to stay with Jackie for 2 weeks not over a year
2017/04/04, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: How about I move to the cottage downstairs?
2017/04/04, 9:34 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho 

You're the one who's being irrational. A tenant can be negotiated with especially when you've stated your reasons. Even better is that you are aware of the inconvenience you will be causing and as such you will compensate the tenant for it.

You're the one who's being irrational. Worst is that you're basing your conclusion on unjustified speculation when you can just pose the situation to the tenant and find out what will it take.

Speak to your tenants. If reason won't make them understand money will.
2017/04/04, 9:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I just made a suggestion
2017/04/04, 9:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Are you rejecting it?
2017/04/04, 9:38 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't want to be telling
2017/04/04, 9:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My tenants my business Salatiso
2017/04/04, 9:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes I'm rejecting it.
2017/04/04, 9:40 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Why?
2017/04/04, 9:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Because you will still be in my house
2017/04/04, 9:40 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I think it's a reasonable middle groyndr
2017/04/04, 9:41 AM - Mpho Mkosana: *ground
2017/04/04, 9:41 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So I'm saying move out of my house and your reasonable solution is to move into my house?
2017/04/04, 9:45 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I won't be in your house
2017/04/04, 9:45 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will give you back your keys
2017/04/04, 9:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Fascinating how your tenants are not my business yet when there's something defective in your house they suddenly become my Business.

Even though stop Msitheli from finishing his work in my house and tell him to prioritize you.

Which I still get blamed for because I "don't" support you despite having made it possible for you to have access to a dependable handyman when you need them
2017/04/04, 9:45 AM - Mpho Mkosana: All you will see is my car in the carport
2017/04/04, 9:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thank you
2017/04/04, 9:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U read that incorectly
2017/04/04, 9:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I said I don't want to tell tenant my business
2017/04/04, 9:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'd like to keep being thrown out of my current home to myself
2017/04/04, 9:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And comment 're tenants being ur business
2017/04/04, 9:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Everything in your life Salatiso matters to me. Everything
2017/04/04, 9:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I'm willing to assist you in everything, was I baffled that you weren't - yes
2017/04/04, 9:56 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So I am not willing to assist despite making sure whenever you need a person to do the work you'll always have access to someone dependable?

The reason I don't get involved with the operational aspects of your property is;
1) I offered you an opportunity to bring your property to be managed through my company at no cost which you rejected.

2) Your expectations of Msitheli and mine are different, since you know what you want you tell him. He delivers what i want according to my expectations. Secondly I know his limits but to me the fact that he's always there whenever i need him matters more than delivering a flawless job.
2017/04/04, 9:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I didn't reject your offer
2017/04/04, 9:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Can we solve the move out please
2017/04/04, 9:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And not steer to other stuff at this moment?
2017/04/04, 9:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I have no issue discussing what we clearly needed to but for now let's discuss this
2017/04/04, 10:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Then you go and throw it to me that you've been there for me with my tenant issues which is a lie.

When i was building i borrowed money from you which i promptly paid back. To express my gratitude i even went on to pay for your paving and your card but each time you make it seem like you've selflessly done things i don't nothing.

Just so you know, i have 3 other properties which have tenant and structural issues. I deal with them. I have no expectation which i throw on you when things go wrong there. I fix it.

When you offer me what you can I'm grateful for it, i don't stomp on you because you didnt have money in the card which was not requested. I don't stomp on you for not going to oversee the work done by people you refer to me....I handle them.

What you give i accept and be content. You, i give you a person, then I'm supposed to have money available then I'm supposed to oversee their deliverables.

You
2017/04/04, 10:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I didn't ask you for money
2017/04/04, 10:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I asked for the use of your card
2017/04/04, 10:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Which I was going to refund you for
2017/04/04, 10:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I think you chose what to remember and what to forget Salatiso
2017/04/04, 10:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My recommendations I brought to the house
2017/04/04, 10:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I showed around
2017/04/04, 10:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I got good prices for
2017/04/04, 10:06 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Mike, Norbit etc
2017/04/04, 10:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Which the card was there to use, using a card and using money in the card are 2 different things. The card was there to use, you crucified me for not telling you that there was no money in the card.
2017/04/04, 10:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And u did ask me for my card
2017/04/04, 10:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And it did have money
2017/04/04, 10:09 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes you brought mike and norbit which i was grateful for; I handled them. Whether they did a good or bad job was never blamed on you, i dealt with it
2017/04/04, 10:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not true
2017/04/04, 10:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I did go look at their work
2017/04/04, 10:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I got lower amount for Norbit
2017/04/04, 10:10 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I never asked for you card, i asked to use money in your credit card with the promise that i will not only pay it back but settle whatever else balance.

Which I did.
2017/04/04, 10:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You did ask Salatiso
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U said u need cash
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't disagree with the rest of what you are saying
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But you did ask
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: "I never asked for you card, i asked to use money in your credit card with the promise that i will not only pay it back but settle whatever else balance.

Which I did."
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And there nothing wrong with that
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Read the statement again
2017/04/04, 10:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: We were in a relationship
2017/04/04, 10:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I did...not sure what you want me to see
2017/04/04, 10:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I asked for money in the card

That's what i want you to see.
2017/04/04, 10:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: ...okkaaayyy
2017/04/04, 10:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I asked for the card
2017/04/04, 10:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Was going to replace the money
2017/04/04, 10:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Then there's the crutches which I swear I was blamed for consistently.

An incident happened with U Msitheli taking the crutches. You brought it to my attention and;
1) I confirmed the incident no Msitheli
2) I told him to get the crutches back but he had given them to his aunt in Zimbabwe and that was an issue.

I could have been harsh with him and terminated his relationship which would have meant that both you and me would struggle the next time we need his services so instead;

1) I told him he would pay the cost of new crutches and a penalty,
2) I gave you authorisation that the next time you find the crutches irrespective of the cost you can use my card and pay for them

But no you didn't
So again after being consistently blamed i ask my sister to find red crutches which she does and buys

But now that there's crutches you decide that you want to look for the crutches..... Something you could have done ages ago.

After i had offered to take full accountability and face the owner
2017/04/04, 10:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U never told me crutches were in Zim
2017/04/04, 10:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U said u would find crutches
2017/04/04, 10:21 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So rather than solve the problem and with no financial burden on your you preferred to blame me and eventually when i solve the problem you decide to opt for a solution....

Which you could have earlier...

With the means i had provided...
2017/04/04, 10:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You left me in the dark with the whole crutch thing
2017/04/04, 10:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I kept asking and you would give vague answers
2017/04/04, 10:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I - asked - you volunteered no info - at all
2017/04/04, 10:23 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Vague answers which were 'Ive told him to bring them back and he's waiting but it's taking long"
2017/04/04, 10:23 AM - Mpho Mkosana: The crutch thing became my issue for someone else wrong doing
2017/04/04, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/04/04, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U said I've told him
2017/04/04, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's it
2017/04/04, 10:24 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes

Which I took full accountability for because Msitheli is my problem
2017/04/04, 10:24 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: For the good he brings i will take the bad
2017/04/04, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I ended up going all the way to Pretoria yesterday looking for these crutches
2017/04/04, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I went to 5 discems
2017/04/04, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: They don't have them anymore
2017/04/04, 10:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: They had pink
2017/04/04, 10:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I repeated an exercise that I had done already in jhb when this initially started
2017/04/04, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso
2017/04/04, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm tired of this phone fight
2017/04/04, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Let's please discuss the move
2017/04/04, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I need to work
2017/04/04, 10:27 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: After having hung the issue on me for weeks

Consistently reminding me i was to blame

Even though i had told you I search ed for these things everywhere to no avail
2017/04/04, 10:28 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: What do you want to discuss about the move
2017/04/04, 10:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm happy to carry on after school tonight if you want
2017/04/04, 10:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As mentioned I think cottage beneath is a good conpromise
2017/04/04, 10:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I won't be in your immediate house
2017/04/04, 10:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: That is not an option
2017/04/04, 10:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: But we can talk when you're done with your test
2017/04/04, 10:31 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Totally off topic....

What job did your father do?
2017/04/04, 10:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Why?
2017/04/04, 10:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And you need to consider me too in this - it's horrible enough for me that I'm finding myself out again
2017/04/04, 10:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm interested that's all
2017/04/04, 10:46 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I have been considering you and I still am.
2017/04/04, 10:48 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I was on your case re the Msitheli thing because 1. U seemed not to care and blasé whenever I brought it up. I'm stressed cause I look careless with someone else's possessions. And I know in my shoes you would have been livid. But with me you seemed not to care
2017/04/04, 10:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Have considered you throughout the whole process of us not only being together but moving together.

That is why nothing was imposed, it was always in hope that you'll gradually adjust, understand that a relationship serves to distribute the load and you'll gradually work towards that distribution.

That was me being considerate.

Even when I've said move out it was with you being considered because unless we either solve the problem it will fester and destroy both of us.
2017/04/04, 10:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No you are not considering me
2017/04/04, 10:50 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Being asked to move and disrupt my life is not being considerate
2017/04/04, 10:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Why would i be livid about an incident?

The issue was not intentional, such happen.

But I've always made sure you have the means to remedy it.
2017/04/04, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes - me to redemy
2017/04/04, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You would be
2017/04/04, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And u know you would
2017/04/04, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Your words...unless we either solve the problem it will fester and destroy both of us
2017/04/04, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Agreed
2017/04/04, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That point does consider me
2017/04/04, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's the only thing that considers me in this whole conversation -so please don't undermine my intelligence by saying that kicking me out is for my good.
2017/04/04, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: The truth is u were angry with the Msitheli thing
2017/04/04, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Because I had the audacity to be upset with you
2017/04/04, 11:02 AM - Mpho Mkosana: For asking for support 're Msitheli helping me
2017/04/04, 11:02 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's what's led to this cause your anger is creating bad vibes in the house thAt you are creating with your anger
2017/04/04, 4:39 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/04/05, 8:10 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>

2017/04/05, 10:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: He had to add Vaseline
2017/04/06, 8:37 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Initial plan was to get the couch in Melville, swop it with a second hand; redo it and put it in the cottage.

That's not gonna work hence now the second hand or new couch will have to be for the cottage.

So the guys won't be going to Melville anymore, they just came and took your couch which they will redo
2017/04/06, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok - are we doing the braai with oVisa on the public holiday?

2017/04/06, 9:26 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok

2017/04/06, 2:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Would you prefer the house?
2017/04/06, 2:30 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Doesn't matter but if it's away don't invite the others.
2017/04/06, 2:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Others were included in the invite though at inception
2017/04/06, 2:35 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/04/06, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But mna I'm not going away with a pregnant woman that's about to pop.

Oh and irrespective of where it is le nkwenkwe ka Tina is not invited

2017/04/07, 11:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Oh and the 10 grand i asked you to transfer, did you?

I'll return the money in June with R2500 interest, I've just got some urgent expenses and my clients are not paying quick enough.
2017/04/07, 11:30 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Last thing, we need a fridge.

It must be frost free, don't now door, plumbed and dispense both water and ice.

Budget is 15 grand.
2017/04/07, 11:42 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Remember either the current fridge will move downstairs or the one in the lapa will be fixed and moved Downstairs.

I also promised U Visa a bigger fridge in exchange for  the smaller one in Ridgeway, so it'll either be the fixed one or the current one.
2017/04/07, 11:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok and Ok
2017/04/07, 1:43 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ordinarily I would be heading home now but there's a nincompoop that set a meeting until 15:30
2017/04/07, 1:44 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Have you gone home?
2017/04/07, 1:44 PM - Mpho Mkosana: About to

2017/04/07, 1:45 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Don't now door?
2017/04/07, 1:45 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Spoke to a guy at Hitch's next to Makro in Struben's valley and he seems like an excellent sales person
2017/04/07, 1:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Double door
2017/04/07, 1:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hirshes?
2017/04/07, 1:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yeah they are great
2017/04/07, 1:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So the fridge will have to have its doors removed to come into the house
2017/04/07, 1:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Where's Strubens Valley?
2017/04/07, 1:47 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Eish

2017/04/07, 1:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you care 're brand?
2017/04/07, 1:48 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I have his business card somewhere but he must arrange all that when they deliver.
2017/04/07, 1:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes I do care.

I'd prefer a Bosch but I can't afford it.

There's Hi Sense for R13000 at Makro but I'm septic since current one has a leak
2017/04/07, 1:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Seems like Samsung is the only viable option.
2017/04/07, 1:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Warranty is also key when buying 

I want to say I can up the budget to 17 but seems like a waste for a fridge that will serve 2 people
2017/04/07, 1:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: And i don't want to up the budget
2017/04/07, 1:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: O
2017/04/07, 1:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/07, 1:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Bosch and samsung
2017/04/07, 1:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Remember,

Only reason I'm considering Samsung is price but I hate the brand.
2017/04/07, 1:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Defy?
2017/04/07, 1:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Age?
2017/04/07, 1:52 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've had bad experience with them,.

2017/04/07, 1:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: What you could do is go to Solar Boyz for me and get that quote.

After the incident with the electricity going off i decided to put in backup for the house. Inverter and batteries
2017/04/07, 1:59 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Where's solar boyz
2017/04/07, 2:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The solar boys company is not far from the second circle when you come from builders, before you turn left to go to the house.

You can play
2017/04/11, 11:55 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm lost,

With 130 million why would you study?

Studying for me is a means towards an end, I studied so that I could be able to make money. When i have money i would have no motivation to study, i know enough.
2017/04/11, 12:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm learning
2017/04/11, 12:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And being knowledgeable makes life richer in my mind

You can choose to go to Hitch's if you think you can get a better deal. Fridge and bed.

Best in the bedroom will go to visitors room,

Bed in visitors goes to cottage and

The new bed we will sleep in so choose carefully.
2017/04/12, 12:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Budget is 20k for items and delivery.

Remember to tell the guy that when they deliver they must send someone to remove and reinstall the doors because it won't fit through the kitchen.
2017/04/12, 12:40 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/12, 1:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What's the guys name again?
2017/04/12, 1:44 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ashley

The big Ashley
2017/04/12, 2:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: For the French door fridge please compare the Hi Sense to the Samsung.

The former seems bigger and more energy efficient for a less price and more guarantee years.
2017/04/12, 2:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/12, 3:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>

2017/04/12, 3:23 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Remember
2017/04/12, 3:24 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But is it the best price we can pay
2017/04/12, 3:25 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Leave everything,

We'll do together because i think you're not paying the best price
2017/04/12, 3:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok

2017/04/13, 9:25 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: It doesn't matter where as long as she can get the training
2017/04/13, 10:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Was not being condescending, just wanted to explain
2017/04/13, 10:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Didn't mean it in a bad way, can't expect you to know what modules were in my undergrad
2017/04/13, 5:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>

The confirmed that the first thing most likely to break is the ice maker
2017/04/13, 5:41 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Plus these are bigger,

Way more energy efficient (A++)

And within budget
2017/04/13, 5:41 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That French door hi sense has no ice maker
2017/04/13, 5:41 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: And it requires a professional to fit through the doors
2017/04/13, 5:42 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: These 2 can fit through the door no issues 

Yes no ice maker but i can live with it
2017/04/13, 5:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did you ask if the French door can fit through a single door

2017/04/18, 3:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do you mind if I use your screen for the lapa?

It's not suitable to be used as an extension screen, technology too old.
2017/04/18, 3:52 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's fine for multimedia but horrible for productivity.

Just bring it when you eventually come, problem is I'm not certain what time I will leave.
2017/04/21, 9:52 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: In the hope it doesn't die,

But should it die the ish happens.
2017/04/22, 12:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The bed she showed you does  not have memory foam and they're actually bad quality because they have collapsing sides which means they will not give great support from the beginning
2017/04/22, 1:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/04/22, 3:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Why did U tell Delight to wash this mat

2017/04/25, 12:13 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not going to renew the StarSat subscription,

2017/04/28, 10:46 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just report it as stolen and get a case number.

I'll need to send this to Telkom as that is an employer issued device.
2017/04/28, 10:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/28, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Was just thinking about something
2017/04/28, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Shouldn't the affidavit be under your name?
2017/04/28, 11:02 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No,

An affidavit is a legal document so it must reflect the truth. You used the phone with my consent  I so there's no need to lie.

Lying on a  legal document is a criminal offense and I'm not eager to go to jail.
2017/04/28, 11:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/28, 11:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: The phone is insured for R5500, minimum excess is 10%.

Could be higher because I have made a cellphone claim but that will be confirmed after lodging the claim.
2017/04/28, 11:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/04/28, 12:49 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What soap did you use in the dishwasher, there was soap all over the floor. Soap in the dishwasher when it was done and dishes were still full of food
2017/04/28, 12:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Sunlight with the rinse/ shine liquid
2017/04/28, 12:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Not to be repeated had to rewash
2017/04/28, 12:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can't repeat it, 

Wash trying to finish the rinsing liquid and now it's finished
2017/04/28, 12:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did you put rinse aid in it's own slot?
2017/04/28, 12:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Or maybe it was just too much soap
2017/04/28, 12:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes
2017/04/28, 1:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you generally feed the Gardner?

2017/04/28, 1:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I generally feed him.

2017/05/02, 4:40 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Work, my friend passing away, my sisters friend passing away - it's just been a crummy month
2017/05/02, 5:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I want to say something
2017/05/02, 5:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Something I don't wanna hear?
2017/05/02, 5:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If you're gonna make a comment about people dying - don't
2017/05/02, 5:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did you get home ok?
2017/05/02, 5:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: What do you think of a crèche/ pre school business
2017/05/02, 5:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Have actually thinking about it
2017/05/02, 5:41 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: All that's required is a property with fixtures.

I think the number of caregivers per child is dictated by legislation.

These things make money irrespective of where they are.

If one child is about R2500 - R3500 (average 3) 10 kids is 30 k with 20 grossing 60 k.

Subtract the property costs at around 10 - 15 k, salaries at say 15 max.

20 kids could easily net 20 k. And that's a conservative estimate.
2017/05/02, 5:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Home,

Didn't puke but

Felt (and still) like it though.
2017/05/02, 5:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Nothing a bit of weed can't cure.

2017/05/04, 10:22 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Since the purchase there hasn't been even one correspondence
2017/05/04, 10:23 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hmmmm
2017/05/04, 10:23 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes I will follow up but I should you have to

2017/05/04, 10:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: The one saying it's been despatched etc
2017/05/04, 10:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Did you put in correct info?
2017/05/05, 10:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: We're going to have to talk about your statements yesterday because the more I think about it the more I get irritated.

First of all you insinuated that just because I make more money I should automatically pay for things as though it's my fault you make less money.

Secondly you virtually pay for less than 10% of our living expenses, 5% of that 10% you created. Even specific to the dogs,  the biggest expanse I still cover to the tune of more than 4 grand a year.

Thirdly I deem my dogs as my dogs, when they cock up I own up. I discipline them and then pay the expense. That's why I bought the creepy, replaced the pipes so many times my dogs have damaged them and continuously pay for loss they create.
2017/05/05, 10:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/05, 10:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm sorry
2017/05/05, 10:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Apology accepted.

2017/05/07, 10:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: A female class teacher was having a problem with a boy in her class in Primary 3.
The boy said, "Madam, I should be in Primary 4. 
I am smarter than my sister and she's in Primary 4".

The Madam had heard enough and took the boy to the principal.
The principal decided to test the boy with some questions from Primary 4.

Principal: What is 3+3?

Boy: 6.

Principal: 6+6.

Boy: 12.

The boy got all the questions right.
The principal told the Madam to send the boy to Primary 4 immediately.
The Madam decided to ask her own questions and the principal agreed.

Madam: What does a cow have 4 of that I have only 2?

Boy: Legs.

Madam: What is in your trousers that I don't have?

Boy: Pockets.

Madam: What starts wit a C and ends with T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?

Boy: Coconut.

Madam: What goes in hard and then comes out soft and sticky?

*The principal's eyes opened really wide, but before he could stop the answer, the boy was taking charge*

Boy: Bubble gum.

Madam: You stick your pole inside me. You tie me down to get me up, I get wet before you do.

Boy: Tent. 

*The principal was looking restless*

Madam: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you are bored. The best man always has me first?.

Boy: Wedding ring.

Madam: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I Drip. When you blow me, you feel good?

Boy: Nose.

Madam: I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates, I come with a quiver.

Boy: Arrow.

Principal: O MY GOD.

Madam: What starts with 'F' and ends wit a 'K' and if you don't get it, you've to use your hand?

Boy: Fork.

Madam: What is it that all men have, it's longer in some men than others, the Pope doesn't use his and a man gives it to his wife after marriage?

Boy: Surname.

Principal: Chinekeme!!.

Madam: What part of the man has no bone but has muscles with a lot of veins like pumpkin and is responsible for making love?

Boy: Heart.

Principal: Eeeeeh!!.. The principal breathed a sigh of relief and said to the Madam, 
"Send this BLOODY boy to the university...
Even I myself got all the answers wrong!"

2017/05/18, 1:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I need the microwave in your house for the cottage, need to work out the logistics for the exchange.

You can either bring it and take yours or I can tell Msitheli to do it.

Whichever suits you.
2017/05/18, 1:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/18, 1:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will figure it out
2017/05/18, 1:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can we come to some sort of arrangement for next month
2017/05/18, 1:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If you recall I had told you my cousin asked to stay with me mid June for 2 nights
2017/05/18, 1:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And later June kid I looked after in the USA
2017/05/18, 1:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: With her friend
2017/05/18, 1:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Also I'm writing exams next month - would it be possible to use the Study next month on some sort of arrangement
2017/05/18, 2:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: When I terminate a relationship I prefer to get rid of all reminders of it.

Already me letting you stay in my cottage is a strain but I'm tolerating it.

Any request above that is too much to ask so please don't.

According to me the day it's over it must be.
2017/05/18, 2:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I hear what you are saying but if you recall one of the reasons I was very reluctant to let go of my room was a situation like this and you promised me that should this day come we would work through it I appreciate you giving me the time to figure it out for the next month but I had made plans that are difficult now to undo a specially the US situation
2017/05/18, 2:26 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho, do not make it as if letting go of your room was forced unto you or it was for my benefit.

I suggested you let go of your room so that you can get income which you can use to plug any financial obligations you might have.

A conservative income of 2 grand over 12 months would have yielded you 24 grand. Taking even half of that money and using it to get your room back would resolve your room issue, aid your tenant to get alternative accommodation and reverse the status quo.

Do not for a second make it as if you letting your room was under duress or that somehow it benefitted me and as such I should be liable for your current situation.
2017/05/18, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I never said it was under duress
2017/05/18, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What I'm referring to is the conversation we had when I let it up you promised me because my biggest fear was exactly what is happening now happening and you said you would work through the situation with me should it come to this
2017/05/18, 2:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I said nothing about duress on my part
2017/05/18, 2:29 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: As for the US situation, what would you have done if you were in your house?
2017/05/18, 2:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Made plans according to my situation
2017/05/18, 2:30 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso
2017/05/18, 2:30 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If you don't consider what I'm doing as working through the situation with you I assure you, I can show you what exactly it means me not working through the situation with you.
2017/05/18, 2:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Having to ask you at this. Is difficult enough for me
2017/05/18, 2:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Only reason I am because I had already made promises to people
2017/05/18, 2:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't understand why you making this a fight
2017/05/18, 2:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Don't worry
2017/05/18, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I  Am taking back requests
2017/05/18, 2:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Again you're making a mountain out of a molehill.

There's tons of B&B's you can book for the people.

Every benefit you derived from me and everything I committed to was within the context of you as my girlfriend.

You're now not so consequently they fall away.

I'm not asking you for anything, I'm making do in my life with what I have. 

Please do the same.
2017/05/18, 2:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/18, 7:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I know just like you think I'm being unreasonable just like you think I've never been there for you.

Just so you know where we are was never my intention but at some point emotion can only go so far.

In the time we've been together;
- I've supported U when you had issues with your property but to U it was never enough. Yet your support never went as far as my properties but was confined to the primary house as it impacted to you.
- I made sure you came home to a house, that had lights on, resources to support your work and amusement and above all was safe.
- I plugged your financial gaps either directly or by making sure you could raise the funds you need.
- Ironically I'm also the one who made sure we travelled and even created tangible plans for more.

You on the other hand, what can you claim to have done?
- Getting someone to clean once a week and the other times forgetting there's a mess?
- U could claim that you bought and cooked food but even those things you didn't do exclusively, bulk of the meat I but and the only time your cooking is consistent is when we fight.
- You watched me from afar working hard towards acquisition of things you benefited from, then lounged about while I did the chores that kept everything working.

Relationships may be fuelled by emotion but we exist in the physical world; money must be earned to buy the house one lives in and toiling to keep that house liveable.

That is why we are where we are, because you live in your head than reality. You don't initiate and see things through. You don't understand that to do the things you want you must do the things you have to and to you are content to claim to be in a relationship but watch from aside as someone makes it work.
2017/05/18, 7:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So while the emotional nonsense will take time because I love you but elsewhere I won't even feel that you're gone because you never played a significant enough role to make an impact.

You will move out of my house and out of my life but other than the emotional nonsense things will go on in my life as though you were never there.
2017/05/18, 7:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I feel like this is a bit like putting the cart before the horse
2017/05/18, 7:57 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You have already decided what you want and acted out accordingly
2017/05/18, 7:57 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And I will respect your decision
2017/05/18, 7:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do I think you are being harsh yes but worse things have happened to nicer people so it will be fine
2017/05/18, 8:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: We clearly speak a different language
2017/05/18, 8:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And the fact that you made a whole lot more money than I did you and were able to provide more was becoming an issue
2017/05/18, 8:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The little things I did clearly did not count
2017/05/18, 8:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But as I said before you have already had this conversation your head without me and have made decisions so we move on
2017/05/19, 3:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Where the Honda was parked yesterday is where you can park until you leave.

To access the house you can use the side door and keep the key.

I'm going to need the remote.
2017/05/19, 3:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/19, 4:45 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How much do I owe you for the phone?
2017/05/19, 4:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't know what you learn from the insurance
2017/05/19, 5:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: ?
2017/05/19, 5:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: the insurance has not replied yet so I don't know how much it is
2017/05/19, 6:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/22, 5:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/05/23, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's like I convinced myself I was ill, have that sickly day after feeling
2017/05/23, 10:26 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: The power of the mind,

I feel exactly the same.
2017/05/23, 10:43 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do you remember the date of the cellphone loss and approximate time?
2017/05/23, 10:43 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Busy with the claim form.
2017/05/23, 10:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Also what was the name of the police station you reported the incident to?
2017/05/23, 10:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Bramley police station
2017/05/23, 10:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Date?
2017/05/23, 10:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Of loss that is ....
2017/05/23, 10:52 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I will put the date as 22 May because I remember it was a Saturday
2017/05/23, 10:52 AM - Mpho Mkosana: 27 April
2017/05/23, 10:52 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/05/23, 10:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It was Thur
2017/05/23, 10:53 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Public holiday
2017/05/23, 11:31 AM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/05/23, 12:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I seriously think I'm coming down with something
2017/05/23, 12:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I feel worse now
2017/05/23, 12:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I think it would be best to tackle it early,

Before it becomes a problem.
2017/05/23, 2:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Butter took out pool pipes again
2017/05/23, 2:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'll replace them tomorrow
2017/05/23, 2:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/05/23, 2:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's there
2017/05/23, 2:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Also looked for it
2017/05/23, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Deep end
2017/05/23, 2:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Emanzini?
2017/05/23, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: To the right
2017/05/23, 2:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/05/23, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes
2017/05/23, 2:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not as concerned about the pipes as I am about the behaviour
2017/05/23, 2:07 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can't keep buying pipes.

Worst is that every time she yanks the pipes out while the pump is running the pump draws air which is causing long term damage to the pump and reducing its lifespan
2017/05/23, 2:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can't we put some kind of net to twart her efforts?
2017/05/23, 2:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: By step to hole
2017/05/23, 2:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ppl I've spoken to say same thing Salatiso, destructive dogs need to have their energy thwarted by walking daily, active play etc
2017/05/23, 2:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's the same for dogs that dig
2017/05/23, 2:12 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Rip gardens apart
2017/05/23, 2:13 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If these dogs were in a small yard that would be justified,

These dogs run around the whole day chasing birds, snakes etc

This is not an excess energy issue.
2017/05/23, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Apparently that's not the case....
2017/05/23, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's like Skhokho
2017/05/23, 2:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: He still rips clothes from the line and he's the most active in the yard
2017/05/23, 2:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will buy balls and try to throw them for dogs again
2017/05/23, 2:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If lack of exercise was the issue S'khokho would be far but he's still as ripped as ever
2017/05/23, 2:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Has nothing  to do with fitness
2017/05/23, 2:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's mental
2017/05/23, 2:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Boxers are worker dogs
2017/05/23, 2:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Need discipline
2017/05/23, 2:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Lady at training said this, this type of dog needs a master
2017/05/23, 2:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And needs to take direction regularly
2017/05/23, 2:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: When S'khokho rips clothing it's not a boredom issue but ukudelela.

When I hang clothes S'khokho does not touch it but when someone else does it he will destroy it just to show he doesn't regard the authority of the other person.
2017/05/23, 2:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I tend to disagree with you
2017/05/23, 2:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said before,

Do you want to deal with Butta or should I?
2017/05/23, 2:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Bassonia Skhokho was still ripping clothes you eft outside
2017/05/23, 2:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Even when u hung a belt warning him
2017/05/23, 2:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will
2017/05/23, 2:20 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Because in Bassonia he stayed in a tiny balcony with only an afternoon walk as a discharge.

No matter how disciplined a dog is or how authoritative the owner gets there are limits.

That is why even in my harshness with S'khokho in Bassonia I had to control how far I went.
2017/05/23, 2:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said, I tend to disagree from what I have read about dogs which was repeated by that training lady
2017/05/23, 2:23 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will definitely agree with the fact that uSkhokho uyadelela
2017/05/23, 2:25 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Again I don't mind that you disagree, 

All I'm saying is you have your way and I have mine.
2017/05/23, 2:27 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The point I'm making though is that when U S'khokho is distractive I know why;
1) Either uyadelela or
2) He's pissed about something and trying to get attention.

Because I know him I can deal with him effectively and correct his behaviour.
2017/05/23, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Tying up the dog will exastibate a bad situation
2017/05/23, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It will make Butter aggresive
2017/05/23, 2:29 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hence I said deal with it because I will now be extreme.

If she gets aggressive I have a solution for that too.
2017/05/23, 2:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Did your symptoms progress?

Is that why you're home?
2017/05/23, 2:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What's up with the threats?
2017/05/23, 2:55 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't understand how you interpret actions as malice.
2017/05/23, 2:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Whenever I have a problem I find solutions.

Sometimes the solutions are extreme and because I know they are I will opt for something less extreme.

It's only when the other solutions have been explored will I do what is necessary.
2017/05/23, 11:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please let the dogs in and please come to bed
2017/05/24, 1:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Uziva njani?
2017/05/24, 2:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm much better
2017/05/24, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How was your day?
2017/05/24, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I woke up happy because some *I really want to use a bad word here but limanyumnyezi kakhulu igama elimfaneleyo and you'd be offended* infuriated me yesterday evening.

But instead of letting that *again the really extreme word* get to me negatively I thought I'd choose to be the opposite.
2017/05/24, 2:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So since the morning happiness I'm still choosing to be happy
2017/05/24, 2:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Wena?
2017/05/24, 2:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Good for you
2017/05/24, 2:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Am actually starting to get a bit tired now but not long until days over
2017/05/24, 2:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Passing the vegetable shop do you have any requests
2017/05/24, 3:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Berry mix
Ginger
Mint leaves
2017/05/24, 3:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/24, 3:52 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/05/25, 3:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How goes your day?
2017/05/25, 4:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 😡
2017/05/25, 4:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What's wrong?
2017/05/25, 4:07 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Much easier to explain what isn't wrong
2017/05/25, 4:07 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You?
2017/05/25, 4:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/25, 4:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What right?
2017/05/25, 4:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Me good
2017/05/25, 4:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's great

You're normally just ok so good is a step up
2017/05/25, 4:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: True
2017/05/25, 4:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Mr Observant
2017/05/25, 4:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So what was good in your day?
2017/05/25, 4:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm alive
2017/05/25, 4:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 😂
2017/05/25, 4:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: That's the only good thing you can think of
2017/05/25, 4:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Not that that's to be sneezed at
2017/05/25, 4:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Agreed

Bigger picture is most important, 

Life
2017/05/25, 4:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But it's also appreciating the small things that makes you realise you are blessed
2017/05/25, 4:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's easy not to see them and take them for granted
2017/05/25, 4:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Like finding money in your pocket
2017/05/25, 4:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Or that melting feeling you get when Skhokho decides you're worth patting him
2017/05/25, 4:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Lol
2017/05/25, 4:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I try to find something to find at least 3 of those a day
2017/05/25, 5:29 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 😂😂😂
2017/05/25, 5:30 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Found R40 this morning in my pants

Felt like a thousand
2017/05/25, 5:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: See what I mean?
2017/05/26, 9:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Never mind about the key,

Msitheli will go to Penny
2017/05/26, 9:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thanks
2017/05/26, 9:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/26, 6:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Instead of giving me money for the access can you sell me the Z3?

Give me a price and we'll work from there.
2017/05/26, 6:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Belinda Sonqayi.vcf (file attached)
2017/05/26, 6:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's the colleague of mine who asked if you could give her some tips and tricks on your hair.
2017/05/26, 6:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How does she know my hair?
2017/05/26, 6:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You can have Z3
2017/05/26, 7:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: she was there when we went for breakfast last year
2017/05/28, 1:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If you can please bring coffee on your way back. 

I'll refund you.
2017/05/28, 1:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not coming back tonight
2017/05/28, 1:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/05/28, 1:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If u still want it tomorrow can bring then
2017/05/28, 1:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please
2017/05/29, 2:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi
2017/05/29, 2:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do you want me to give your number to Belinda (hair)? 

Then she can contact you.
2017/05/29, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hello
2017/05/29, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Sure
2017/05/29, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I messaged her though
2017/05/29, 2:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/05/30, 7:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Can you please send me a picture of the serial number in a white box? 

The box is in the study wardrobe, it's white with dirt marks
2017/05/30, 7:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/05/30, 7:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/05/30, 7:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thank you
2017/05/31, 9:41 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Tried to get into cottage and key is sticking
2017/05/31, 9:41 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Didn't want to break key
2017/05/31, 9:42 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Can we go thru there tonight please
2017/05/31, 9:42 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Have made payment this morning
2017/05/31, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Please take me off alarm sms's
2017/05/31, 10:49 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/05/31, 11:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: The base of the bed can either go down today or tomorrow, you let me know.
2017/05/31, 11:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's up to you
2017/05/31, 11:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not really because if the base goes down today you'll sleep on the mattress on the floor.
2017/05/31, 12:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/31, 12:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Then today
2017/05/31, 12:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can I buy/rent the rest of the gas in gas heater?
2017/05/31, 12:54 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The problem is that sometimes I use the heater. 

You have the small heater/s in the garage so why not use those?
2017/05/31, 12:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Where's your big heater?
2017/05/31, 12:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If you still wanna use your gas I will get another canister
2017/05/31, 12:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Both big heaters are in the house, only issue is the cylinders because my other is on the stove. 

Feel free to buy a cylinder. I might also install a wall panel heater in the cottage but I am not sure when will that happen.
2017/05/31, 1:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/31, 1:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Which of your numbers is registered with DVD?
2017/05/31, 1:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: DnD
2017/05/31, 1:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 0844448309
2017/05/31, 1:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿

Sorted, copied you on the correspondence.
2017/05/31, 1:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes
2017/05/31, 1:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Saw
2017/05/31, 1:25 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So let's agree on the logistical arrangements:
- I will take your couch back to Melville and swop with mine. 

What's your plan for your clothes? 

I don't mind if you keep the stuff that's in the guest bedroom and study there until the end of the month. 

I do however insist that by the end of the week your stuff that's in my bedroom must be removed.
2017/05/31, 1:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/05/31, 1:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Your laptop is in a bag, you can keep that. 

I will however need the Agile back pack because that's Telkom property. 

The tablet, I'm too attached to it so that stays. However should you need a functional PC while in the property I can loan you my other hybrid PC.
2017/05/31, 1:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The bedding and towels, I have no idea what belongs to who so I trust you to take what's yours.
2017/05/31, 1:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Was the tablet not my bday gift?
2017/05/31, 1:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok 're everything else
2017/05/31, 1:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've always said that tablet was for the house, you've had the right of use by virtue of being in the house. 

I have never explicitly said it's yours.
2017/05/31, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: U did
2017/05/31, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: U asked what I wanted for my bday
2017/05/31, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I said tablet
2017/05/31, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You said you will give me yours when you get new one
2017/05/31, 1:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Doubt it but my statement stays, not negotiable so that's that.
2017/05/31, 1:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But it's fine. I will give it back
2017/05/31, 1:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Food, 

You're free take whatever you bought
2017/05/31, 1:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Everything else I'm missing you've got Carte Blanch to take what is yours.
2017/05/31, 1:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Oj
2017/05/31, 1:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: *ok
2017/05/31, 1:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: What are you going to do about the dogs?
2017/05/31, 1:44 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Whatever you decide please be aware that when you move out I would like to not see you for at least 3 months which means you can't come visit. 

I can re evaluate after 3 months but for my coping mechanism I do need full detachment for that period. 

So you can take Butta or be aware that you will not see her for 3 months at least.
2017/06/01, 8:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/06/01, 8:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Is this yours?
2017/06/01, 9:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/06/01, 10:55 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Strange 

Ok
2017/06/01, 2:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Did U speak to Ntobeko about the inspection? 

I told him to be on standby for U.
2017/06/02, 1:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: One of the things you need to look at in cottage is flushing system for toilet. It doesn't pop up-kind of sticks at bottom- lots of wasted water
2017/06/02, 1:20 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'll send Msitheli
2017/06/02, 1:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: He can do it once I've left
2017/06/02, 1:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will make sure to always pull it up
2017/06/02, 1:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Just wanted to tell you
2017/06/02, 1:28 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thanks

2017/06/04, 4:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will come get it
2017/06/05, 11:15 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Some of the things you raised for the cottage need to be addressed immediately, when can Msitheli come and sort them out?

I'm worried that door might fall off (again) and water might cause long term problem on the grouting.
2017/06/05, 11:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I just don't want Msitheli in my space without supervision
2017/06/05, 11:21 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's fine, can I try for the weekend then?
2017/06/05, 11:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: If you are ok to sit with him sure
2017/06/05, 11:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will most probably be studying most of next weekend
2017/06/05, 11:22 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: He's gonna have to come when you're there because so most likely weekend.
2017/06/05, 11:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Well it's up to you
2017/06/05, 11:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Cause study grip starts morning
2017/06/05, 11:34 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'll wait until you move
2017/06/05, 12:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/05, 12:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will be careful with door
2017/06/05, 12:23 PM - Mpho Mkosana: There is that putty in the garage that was for the windows if you bring it out I will cover the non grouted tiles
2017/06/05, 12:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's ok

U can leave it.
2017/06/05, 12:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you have Q10?
2017/06/05, 12:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Tried to lock sliding door all weekend with no success
2017/06/05, 12:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Also if you want I can compile a list that I think would make that space more attractive / user friendly for your future tenants
2017/06/05, 12:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/06/05, 12:40 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Door issue in not lubrication related, it's that crappy aluminium that's falling apart.

The locking grove needs to be expanded.
2017/06/05, 2:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Heti is coming tomorrow to fetch the couch, who can he contact for access in your house?
2017/06/05, 2:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please also check what time will that contact be available in the house.
2017/06/05, 2:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Today?
2017/06/05, 2:48 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Tomorrow most likely
2017/06/05, 2:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Today would have worked better as Delight is there all day
2017/06/05, 2:49 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If not will check with people at the house
2017/06/05, 2:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If he goes to your house today he will only collect which means you'll have the burden of transporting the couch when you leave.

I planned this such that he takes your couch, drop it at you house and pick up mine to save you the cost.
2017/06/05, 2:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/05, 2:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks
2017/06/05, 2:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will speak to house and get back to you
2017/06/05, 5:40 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No one's available
2017/06/05, 5:40 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What time did he want to come thru
2017/06/05, 5:40 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If he does 10am or 12am I can go there and meet him
2017/06/05, 5:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'll tell him
2017/06/05, 5:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 10 am & 12 am or between 10 - 12 am?
2017/06/05, 5:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 10am or 12pm
2017/06/05, 5:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Heti.vcf (file attached)
2017/06/05, 5:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've given him your 084 number
2017/06/07, 8:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi I'm remembering that Delight is at the house this Saturday so maybe Msitheli can come and when he's there she just makes sure she's there with him
2017/06/07, 8:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Ok
2017/06/07, 5:24 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>

2017/06/09, 4:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Are they led?
2017/06/09, 4:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: These ones purport to use 70% less electricity
2017/06/09, 4:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And the company jumped for them
2017/06/09, 4:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I work for the ultimate al cheapos
2017/06/09, 4:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So there must be a difference
2017/06/09, 4:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The bulbs in the house are 4 - 6 watts,
2017/06/09, 4:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Unless I'm not understanding what you're talking about.
2017/06/09, 4:57 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Cool
2017/06/09, 9:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can I give you the phone so that you can enter all the passwords you might have used in the last 2 years?

2017/06/09, 10:39 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/09, 10:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I thought you'd try all the passwords you've used in    the last month s

2017/06/09, 11:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I know
2017/06/09, 11:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The wooden floors were not only because of my love for wood
2017/06/09, 11:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Imagine how bad it was on tile
2017/06/09, 11:21 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But apart from the doors closing  does the audio permeate?
2017/06/09, 11:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Not really
2017/06/09, 11:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Doors
2017/06/09, 11:22 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Heard the dogs paws yesterday
2017/06/09, 11:23 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's more house related sounds
2017/06/09, 11:23 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: ?

2017/06/14, 9:03 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Slipped my mind,

Anyway my mother is not a child, told her we broke up but you're still there for logistic reasons.

If you want I can tell her not to extend conversation with you beyond hi & bye.

2017/06/14, 10:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It looks like track on ground was not laid straight

2017/06/15, 6:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Are you around this weekend? I need to;
- Move the washing machine to the cottage,
- Install bedroom blinds,
- Move some glasses and toaster  downstairs.
2017/06/15, 8:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm partially around
2017/06/15, 8:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You would have to give me times, or I could leave keys with you and you are there whenever anyone is in there
2017/06/15, 10:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just give me a heads up before your leave especially if you see u Msitheli.

Priority is to get the washing machine down there but I can only do it if I have Msitheli around.
2017/06/16, 10:41 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My cousins here so u know whose on your property
2017/06/16, 11:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Noted

2017/06/16, 2:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I told him to take the couch to the workshop overnight,

Tomorrow at 11 he will be at Melville to do the exchange.

Yours is to arrange for 11 at Melville. If 11 will not work tell him what will and finalise.
2017/06/16, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Heti.vcf (file attached)
2017/06/16, 3:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Tomorrow Makro is delivering my washing machine, I will use the same guys to take this washing machine downstairs.

They said they'll be here before 12, if you are to leave before 12 leave the key.
2017/06/16, 6:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Dogs faught

Can't find Butta to check her wounds.
2017/06/16, 6:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Coming
2017/06/16, 6:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Not at house tho
2017/06/16, 6:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I was only telling you just in case tomorrow morning I find one of them dead you're not shocked.
2017/06/16, 6:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not saying come
2017/06/16, 6:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did they have bone?
2017/06/16, 6:20 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's not bones that make the dogs fight, it's Butta 's lack of respect that is going to get her killed.

I have them food, she took her food inside and then came back to bully S'khokho for his food.

I want to pretend like I sympathize but reality is she got what she deserved.
2017/06/16, 6:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So because of this incident now I know the problem.

Consequently I will not deprive my dogs of bones because of one delinquent.

I've seen they can enforce the law between themselves.
2017/06/16, 7:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I can't stop you from doing what you want to do all I ask is of you give them bones you give them one each
2017/06/16, 7:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And not throw so they hunt
2017/06/16, 7:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And that you be strict with eating time. If one of the dogs does not eat their food remove it.
2017/06/16, 7:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks
2017/06/16, 7:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The reason Butta has no disregard for the hierarchy is because I allowed you to raise her your way.

Do not even suggest how I should raise my dogs, from now on its my way.
2017/06/16, 7:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If ever you decide to get a dog, I'd caution you to get docile breeds.

Strong vicious dogs are not for you.
2017/06/16, 7:20 PM - Mpho Mkosana: We can agree to differ
2017/06/17, 9:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/06/17, 9:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/06/17, 9:10 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do not ever get a dog. The way you raised this dog is worse that people who set out to be cruel to animals.

I might be firm but I'm always far. Worst this is that this wound was inflicted by Khali because when Butta attacks S'khokho Khali sides with him because she understands the hierarchy.

If you want to get academic about issues don't get academic with animal that depend on you.
2017/06/17, 9:50 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's like you're trying to pick a fight again. And pointing fingers. And you are perfect and never wrong. Must be nice
2017/06/17, 12:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not not picking a fight I'm just telling you what it is.

Don't need to pick a fight, my dogs will be fine because I will be here and you won't.

I am however cautioning you in the interest of the dogs.
2017/06/17, 12:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Anything I say I can substantiate
2017/06/17, 12:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes u are. Because it serves some purpose for you to demonize me. Of that's what works for you fine.
2017/06/17, 12:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I could substantiate things too Salatiso. But I don't choose to allow myself to be sucked into what you are trying to do
2017/06/17, 12:30 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I can't pretend that I'm not pissed off, which is why I can't bear the thought of what happened to Butta happening to another dog.

None the less all immaterial, in less than a month I'll raise my dogs the way I should have.

You're right you're not to blame, I blame myself for allowing you to intervene which how I raised my dogs.

So I do apologize for laying any blame on you.
2017/06/17, 8:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How was Butta this afternoon
2017/06/17, 8:43 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: She's walking
2017/06/17, 8:44 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She's putting weight on her leg now?
2017/06/17, 8:55 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: She walked downstairs to the front yard and came back.
2017/06/18, 3:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Please tell your visitors when they exit the premises my gate must not be left wide open.

2017/06/18, 4:24 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Did you take the wine opener?
2017/06/18, 4:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: My waiters friend yes
2017/06/18, 4:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The one with 2arms you initially had no
2017/06/18, 4:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The washing machine should be connected by next weekend, nullifying any reason for her to come up.

So please drop of my key when you can.
2017/06/18, 5:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: U don't want her to do your clothes?
2017/06/18, 5:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: No
2017/06/18, 5:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/18, 5:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will have to organise with you for the moving of the rest of the stuff then
2017/06/18, 5:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Could I please have small gate keys
2017/06/18, 5:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's fine.

The decoder is ready, you can have it.
2017/06/18, 5:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Decoder?
2017/06/18, 5:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Besingekho kwesa sitshixo sase zantsi?
2017/06/18, 5:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That cottage will be equipped with a decoder, I was setting it up and now I'm done.
2017/06/18, 5:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/06/18, 5:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: That key has 2 keys for treli and sliding
2017/06/18, 5:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'll have to cut one
2017/06/18, 5:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can I use the one u have for tomorrow
2017/06/18, 5:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/06/18, 5:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can you leave it on the step
2017/06/18, 5:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/06/18, 5:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: By wash line
2017/06/18, 5:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will get in 15mins
2017/06/18, 5:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Key + decoder will be on the balcony, too lazy to go down.

When you drop it leave the keys.
2017/06/18, 5:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/18, 5:24 PM - Mpho Mkosana: For your serviced apartment would you like Delight to come through Saturday's to clean
2017/06/18, 5:35 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Don't know yet,

Will depend on the type of tenant I get.
2017/06/19, 6:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Taking Butts now
2017/06/19, 6:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/06/19, 6:49 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So left Butta at vet as they need to drain her leg
2017/06/19, 6:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Vet said if the dogs are triggered by food when they fight 1) they should be fed in different places altogether and plates removed or 2) Once dog moves away from food food/bowl must be removed
2017/06/19, 6:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Otherwise this will continue
2017/06/19, 6:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It has nothing to do with hierarchy
2017/06/19, 6:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And leaving them with bones will be asking for trouble (she said most dogs swallow bones whole which leads to them packing up so small bones are a horrible idea in any case)
2017/06/19, 6:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And you don't have to believe me. She said if you go see her she would be happy to reiterate
2017/06/19, 6:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Pit bulls are fighters
2017/06/19, 6:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Have no idea why you keep telling me things you know very well I'll disregard.

But if it makes you happy type away.
2017/06/19, 7:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You're so inclined to believe theories because they are consistent with who you are.

If you wanted to find out the real truth you would have taken time to observe the video to see how the incident unfolded but no.

Once again you'd rather believe theories instead of making your mind based on facts.
2017/06/19, 7:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso
2017/06/19, 7:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I told the vet exactly what you told m
2017/06/19, 7:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She gave me feedback after that
2017/06/19, 7:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And the bone incident
2017/06/19, 7:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: And it is a total coincidence that Butta is the only one that always get the worst of the biting.
2017/06/19, 7:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I told her that too
2017/06/19, 7:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She said they are pit bulls, it's in their nature to fight
2017/06/19, 7:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And others will Always side with weakest
2017/06/19, 7:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She's repeating everything the dog trainer said
2017/06/19, 7:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Well,

You're free to take Butta and raise her with both the vet and the trainer.

My house, my dogs, my rules.
2017/06/19, 7:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/19, 7:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: As soon as I can will come get her
2017/06/19, 7:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿

2017/06/20, 10:49 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/20, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Is there a reason why the Renault door is open?
2017/06/20, 11:00 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Probably one of the guys left it open
2017/06/20, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Are they in the property?
2017/06/20, 11:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: If you'd prefer Msitheli can come now if you're there.

He's on my other unit in ElandsRock and I can tell him when he is done he must come through.
2017/06/20, 11:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not that I know of.
2017/06/20, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So should I close the car?
2017/06/20, 11:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No, I will go get Butta now then go study
2017/06/20, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Also motor is making a loud beeping sound
2017/06/20, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But there's electricity
2017/06/20, 11:05 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Don't know,

It'll fix itself hopefully.
2017/06/20, 11:06 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Car door?
2017/06/20, 11:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please close
2017/06/20, 6:44 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Gate works, partially.

To open you must help it a bit by pushing it away from carport while the motor is running.

It touches at the bottom hence the intervention.

Closing is no issue.
2017/06/20, 6:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/06/21, 9:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

What time are you going to be back in the house?
2017/06/21, 9:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not sure

2017/06/21, 12:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's through the freelancer platform. If she's interested she'd have to register and bid for the job.
2017/06/21, 2:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Gents Nokwazi is asking if any one knows an opur/helper/driver/tutor in one who is flexible with location. Or a company that offers that service

2017/06/21, 5:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: ...u had asked what time I'd be back
2017/06/21, 5:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Was assuming you wanted to get into cottage
2017/06/21, 5:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So was doing the courteous thing of informing you that I would not make the time I had indicated
2017/06/21, 5:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thank you for informing me,

It is what is best for you.
2017/06/21, 11:31 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No it's not
2017/06/21, 11:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: In time you'll understand I've always prioritised what's best for you, don't think you have as much as you think.

2017/06/21, 11:33 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Good point....


It's no longer a request: come up.
2017/06/21, 11:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

What is happening has nothing to do with feeling. 

I made it clear what I feel for you is not why we are where we are, it's why we got that far.

2017/06/23, 11:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's fine,

As I said last time when you cried after we had sex... again. I didn't do what I did because I did love you, it's because I do.

2017/06/24, 11:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: By the way here's the terms;

- Relationships work because each partner acknowledge s and respects the other's strengths.

You are going to leave but should you choose to come back;

2017/06/25, 1:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: By the end of the week you will be gone, you will have questions so here's the answers in advance;

- I told you whatever you do never leave, it was your choice to go,
- You'll ask if I ever loved you, answer: If it wasn't because I loved you we wouldn't have lasted a second,
- I know I have dominant personality, that was the reason I moved out of my house as well just like like you did out of yours...I hoped we'd buy the house together to even the odds.
- I made you my equal even though you were not buy because I believed you were even greater than me but never realised your strength,
- The fact is even if I was realistic at the end I still made sure you knew I had your back to go back to school, hence the drawers, offering you could get rid of yours car,  not bothering you with household finances.....it was so you could have funds to fund your success,
- My job was to sort out the practical which I believe I do, what was yours?

So when you cry ... Blame  me for everything
2017/06/25, 1:16 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Until you leave however make a plan to bring that ass up daily at a minimum.....

Sad to admit but I'm addiction....

2017/06/27, 11:32 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Quite nice,

Not sure about the lion's though.
2017/06/27, 9:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So Where's this?
2017/06/28, 6:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Kruger
2017/06/28, 7:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: My cousin has moved from Cape Town to here,

He needs a place to stay so naturally it's only fair I offer.

Problem is I know 2 grown men in one house (more specifically my house) is never a good idea.

I'd like him to use the cottage until end July to give him enough time to understand Joburg and get a place.

Andazi when you were planning to move but I'd like request you avail the cottage from Saturday.

If you're not sorted you can move up and him down.

I know this might be inconvenient for you but ndiyakucela.
2017/06/28, 9:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will try make a plan to be out by Sunday
2017/06/28, 9:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: *Saturday
2017/06/28, 9:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok

Thanks
2017/06/28, 9:24 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Is Delight sorted to enter the premises?

Is there a way for her to access the house or should I leave the side door open?
2017/06/28, 9:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She's sorted thanks
2017/06/28, 9:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Have left her keys to get in to your place
2017/06/28, 9:26 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/06/29, 4:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm making eisbein
2017/06/29, 4:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you want the other half?
2017/06/29, 4:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes thanks
2017/06/29, 6:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do you want to come up?

I have a movie and I think it's such a waste to heat 45 sqm for one person.

And it'll be much easier to tell you to sleep up here later of you're already here.
2017/06/29, 6:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'll take your movie and your heat of but no to sleep over
2017/06/29, 6:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: When are you starting movie?
2017/06/29, 6:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Now,

Coming down to get wood and then it's on.
2017/06/29, 6:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I have a cold, not flu so I'm not contagious.

There, now you're sleeping here.
2017/06/29, 6:24 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/06/30, 6:28 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You don't have to sit downstairs alone if you don't want, only condition is if you come up here entry fee is a bag of wood.
2017/06/30, 8:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Are you watching something?
2017/07/01, 8:14 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Fed dogs

2017/07/01, 4:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Should I bring some for you even though ure not crazy about pasta?
2017/07/01, 4:59 PM - Mpho Mkosana: About to leave, speak or forever hold your peace....

2017/07/01, 5:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/07/01, 7:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I meant to ask if you could take my study chair back to your study would rather not have other people using it and I will fetch it with the rest of my stuff in a couple of months time thank you
2017/07/01, 7:28 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: No problem
2017/07/04, 3:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi Mpho,

I trust you're well.

Please cancel any arrangements you had for Delight to come here Saturday, totally forgot I'm doing Visa's negotiations.
2017/07/04, 3:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok, can she come Thursday?
2017/07/04, 3:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thursday is fine
2017/07/04, 4:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi, Delight Will do next Thursday if that's ok with you will remind you closer to that time
2017/07/04, 5:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thats fine thanks
2017/07/12, 1:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi Salatiso, Delight asked to come Saturday rather than tomorrow. Is that ok?
2017/07/12, 2:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Please remind me again what Delight is still to do?

If it's to sort out your stuff can't she come the week/ day preceding the collection?
2017/07/12, 2:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Wanted her to pack all my stuff in the pantry and put away
2017/07/12, 2:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: As well as she said she left some of my clothes on the line
2017/07/12, 2:37 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: She can come Saturday
2017/07/12, 2:44 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks
2017/07/14, 8:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Dogs had another fight,

It'll be luck if Butta is still alive tomorrow.
2017/07/14, 8:49 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Please take her to 24hr clinic
2017/07/14, 8:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will pay
2017/07/14, 8:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Don't ask questions you know answers to.

Just be aware, if when I wake up she is alive but suffering I will put her down.
2017/07/14, 8:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm just asking you to take her Salatiso
2017/07/14, 8:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm really far otherwise I would come get her
2017/07/14, 9:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm on my way
2017/07/14, 9:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm 5mins away, can you please at least open so I can take the dog
2017/07/29, 9:34 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi Salatiso, what's the name of the organization your friends apart of that assist you to buy property and coaches
2017/07/29, 9:41 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

I've never used such; spoke to friends, bond originators and read.
2017/07/29, 9:42 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I didn't say that you used
2017/07/29, 9:42 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I said the one your friends a part of
2017/07/29, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: The one you said drives a Bentley
2017/07/29, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And he had said he was gonna try to get you in
2017/07/29, 10:05 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's a funding institution, part of the Gauteng government.

Have no idea what it's called but you should be able to find it under government agencies in Gauteng.
2017/07/29, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks
2017/07/31, 11:42 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Can we have a chat when   you have a chance
2017/07/31, 11:49 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho

Unjani?
2017/07/31, 11:49 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Telephone conversation or text?
2017/07/31, 12:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I was thinking in person
2017/07/31, 12:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Maybe later this week?
2017/07/31, 12:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm flexible,

As long as you're willing to come to the South.
2017/07/31, 12:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can't I catch you on the way back from work?
2017/07/31, 12:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not likely.
2017/07/31, 12:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But you can try, 

Chances though are that it will not be later this week.
2017/07/31, 12:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/07/31, 12:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You tell me
2017/07/31, 12:10 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Whenever you can
2017/07/31, 12:13 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: To manage your expectation though just know unless it's business I have no other reason not to be at my house.

So just know unless I have a business engagement that I can see you after you will not see me.
2017/07/31, 12:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/05, 9:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi Salatiso, am in Alberton today for studies, can we meet in the parking lot of that plastic store in an hour?
2017/08/05, 9:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It won't be long
2017/08/05, 9:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: 5mins max
2017/08/05, 9:28 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Can you just tell me what is so pressing?

Stop complicating things.
2017/08/05, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not complicating anything
2017/08/05, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I asked for 5minutes of your time
2017/08/05, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's all
2017/08/05, 9:36 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not going to Alberton

You are complicating things because seeing I've been very clear about my disinterest to go out of my way for you you should have explored alternatives.

Either way what you want to say on text or come to my house to say it. I am not coming to you even if you were at builders
2017/08/05, 9:58 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I seriously don't understand what is so important that it can't be texted if you don't want to comply to my terms.

Even if you were pregnant that too could be texted.
2017/08/06, 9:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I didn't really think that this was something to be said over a text but if you prefer it this way. I am pregnant, and I need to tell my family but I thought it was right that you know first. I have no personal expectations of you at this time. I know the families will have to speak though. I will tell you once he's born and we can have a discussion then on how to go forward.
2017/08/06, 10:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho

Im guessing you're telling me because;
I) You're alleging I'm The father,
II) You've decided to keep it.

In relation to point (I)I will acknowledge partenity subject to confirmation once the child is born. As such I undertake to;
1) Support you throughout your pregnancy as may be reasonable,
2) I will do right by your family and pay the damages,
3) Once the baby is born I will accept the terms of joint custody, however you're more than welcomed to give me my baby once she/ he's born.
4) With regard to the medical expenses once the baby is born I will put him/ her or them on my medical aid.
5) will work out the detail in relation to the financial support, visits etc post pregnancy.

In relation to point (II) I am fully aware it is your body, the choice on whether to keep it or not is up to you so in this regard I it is all up to you.

I trust this is in order but if you want to add please feel free.
2017/08/06, 10:33 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's fine
2017/08/06, 10:52 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can I please have more details on the specifics;

1) Do you feel healthy?
2) Is the embryo healthy?
3) How far along are you?
4) What is the anticipated due date?
2017/08/06, 12:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yes I'm fine
2017/08/06, 12:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Dr did tests this week and everything came out as fine
2017/08/06, 12:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Conception btwn 23-26th June
2017/08/06, 12:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Due date late March
2017/08/06, 1:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok,

If you need anything let me know.
2017/08/06, 1:21 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/07, 5:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho

Listen, I'm sorry that you had to find out alone that you were pregnant alone. I know it must have been difficult for you because between your family, study etc a pregnancy was not in your plans.

I know it's not part of your plan to have a child out of wedlock and I know you're probably not sure how to tell your family.

Despite how you know I feel about kids I'm however not sorry that it's you who had to carry my first born. I don't think you want to go through the experience alone and quite frankly I don't want to miss the experience.

I would like to be there for you, more importantly now more than ever I think we need to talk so please make time to come over. Today would be great
2017/08/07, 5:21 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/07, 8:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi Salatiso, I'm ok to talk but I'm not going to your house, we can meet somewhere if you want. Adding to what you have said above I have no issue with you being a part of all things baby, gynae appts etc will send you dates and times. Have told my family they have been extremely supportive so am not alone.
2017/08/07, 8:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok,

I respect that.

Just know you are where you are because that's where you choose to be.
2017/08/07, 9:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I disagree with that, I'm where I am because these are the cards I've been dealt, and I'm doing the best I can with my lot.
2017/08/07, 9:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't want to get into this right now, I don't think you want to either.

Until you choose otherwise my interest in you is as far as my baby goes.

You must have been shocked to find out you were pregnant, I knew already.

There's a ton of shit I've fucked up in my life, I will not fuck up my child's life. From when I was 11 my sole life goal was to make sure that if ever I have a child they will get a better life than I did, so I worked hard and planned hard.

This is now the moment, I'm prepared.
2017/08/07, 9:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't doubt you will do the best you can for your child Salatiso
2017/08/07, 9:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I'm not trying to pick a fight with you that's not who I am. But I do think we need to be realistic
2017/08/07, 9:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And a part of that is you being honest about as you put it your interest in me being the child
2017/08/07, 9:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not saying we shouldn't be civil
2017/08/07, 9:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I've always tried to be that
2017/08/07, 9:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I believe it's on the child best interest to have a decent relationship
2017/08/07, 9:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hence from the start I've tried to do what's right, not what I feel.
2017/08/07, 9:27 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't understand.

I'm definitely sure you're not implying that I only care about you all of a sudden because you're carrying my seed.

You definitely know better.
2017/08/07, 9:33 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just to jog your memory in case you forgot. That was the day after.

And for the record everything I said I meant.

And as I told you in the cottage I will give you three months to figure out whether you want to come back or not.

This is month 3.
2017/08/07, 9:33 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm confused at what you are trying to say? 
Day before you said you would not go out of your way for me , builders was too far. Know your tune has changed...since I'm pregnant.
2017/08/07, 9:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I am so confused....there was never a 3month return clause...
2017/08/07, 9:39 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I think you had this convo in your mind
2017/08/07, 9:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No,

My tube has changed because you choose to hear what suits you.

One of the things I told was that you have no follow through. You're the one who wanted to talk to me, I availed myself but you once again didn't follow through.

I will not keep feeding the monster.
2017/08/07, 9:40 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I recall you sending what looked to be a drunken whatsapp with you saying should I come back I need to be ok with you having been with someone
2017/08/07, 9:41 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I sent that on the 24
2017/08/07, 9:41 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I need to see a client. Will chat to you later
2017/08/07, 9:43 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: You're more than welcomed to do what you want as I said.

But remember whatever happens to you is because of you.

I still stand by what I said and my terms still remain the same.
2017/08/07, 10:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You say everything happens because of me, I think that's a cop out on your part as I was not in this alone. You set the field and I react/make a move from that position. You practically treated me like a dog the last time I was at your place in front of your family, which is why I'm ok not to open up myself to that kind of treatment again. I'm ok to meet you in a neutral place. You want to dictate and I must jump. It doesn't work that way.
2017/08/07, 10:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U said nothing about 3months coming back, that's all new to me
2017/08/07, 10:15 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And as I've said before you and I have different ideas of what a relationship is - I would never say the things you say for someone I care about. You're not interested in mine which I've accepted.
2017/08/07, 10:16 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Treated you like a dog? Because I was distant you interpret that as treating you like a dog?

Mpho I know you might not believe this but I too have a heart. It is unbearable to love someone and see them leaving. 

I shut off because that shit hurts like hell. Just because I don't act it it doesn't t mean I don't feel.
2017/08/07, 10:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not picking up my calls re Butta?
2017/08/07, 10:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Refusing to come to the door and having your nephew give me things thru burglar bar
2017/08/07, 10:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Refusing to help me with my dog
2017/08/07, 10:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: After I asked
2017/08/07, 10:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not sure what you call that bit to me it's blatant meanness and you going out of your way to kick me in the stomach
2017/08/07, 10:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said my terms stay as they are.

That child you're carrying his/ her future has been planned and taken care of before you were even capable of conceiving. Everything you've known me for in the last 2 years revolved around working hard to build a home for my family and a future for my child.

So you choose how you want to feature in that picture, I am very capable of handling my shit fully.
2017/08/07, 10:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I never said you are not capable of anything Salatiso
2017/08/07, 10:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: All I said is can we be civil
2017/08/07, 10:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And realistic
2017/08/07, 10:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You're trying to make it something I never said
2017/08/07, 10:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As mentioned before if you want to speak that's fine in a neutral place
2017/08/07, 10:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will.keep you informed on all fronts when it comes to baby
2017/08/07, 10:23 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm ok to try to build a relationship to make sure we are the Best for our child
2017/08/07, 10:24 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: And this whole thing about Butta, you know my stance on that regard.

It's been more than a month now S'khokho and Khali haven't almost killed each other. I bet if you re introduced Butta again there will be a dead dog in a week.

My ways may not be ideal because they dog come adorned in pretty flowers and fluffy crap. But you know what, my ways work.

If you have any doubts have a look at my life as testimony, if I claim it I can back it.
2017/08/07, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't want to fight with you
2017/08/07, 10:24 AM - Mpho Mkosana: If anything would like to avoid that
2017/08/07, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And you're trying to pick a fight again
2017/08/07, 10:25 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I was talking about the way you treated me
2017/08/07, 10:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Not our different ways of raising dogs
2017/08/07, 10:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But you had to make it about something else
2017/08/07, 10:26 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Namely you always being right and me wrong
2017/08/07, 10:26 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Fight avoided, I'm not going to say anything else.

The next time I see you will be due to the child.

If you want to talk you know where that child's home is. And your 3 months will end on the last day of August after that the only thing that will connect us will be the child.

Tick tock
2017/08/07, 10:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso, I'm not doing this anymore
2017/08/07, 10:27 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Bye Mpho

Enjoy your week.
2017/08/07, 10:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said I want to be civil, and don't think you throwing ultimatums and threats is it
2017/08/07, 10:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But help me understand this 3month thing you have in your head
2017/08/07, 10:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Only thing I want to ask is if you want me to end the 3 months which I gave today so that we know where we are.

I'm horny as hell be I was hoping you'd be the last woman I sleep with, if that won't be then I might as well move on and recalibrate my head.
2017/08/07, 10:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I was chucked out to what
2017/08/07, 10:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Unsettled from my life during exams to what?
2017/08/07, 10:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That in 3months I come back and?
2017/08/07, 10:31 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Come back and hope I don't get thrown out again?
2017/08/07, 10:31 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm trying to understand your reasoning here
2017/08/07, 10:32 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Last I checked you said we were over
2017/08/07, 10:32 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Now there a 3month what?
2017/08/07, 10:36 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Have you ever seen someone getting chucked out?

People who get chucked out don't get to be given alternative space, their stuff doesn't get to be stored where they were chucked out and they don't get an open invitation should they change their mind
2017/08/07, 10:38 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: All you have to do right now is to tell me you are not coming back and I must let you be.

I assure you are that I will move on and you'll never hear me talking with you in that context.

Just say it.
2017/08/07, 10:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said the most pressing issue right now is my need to get laid, I'd rather it be you. Not because I can't find someone else but because you're the only one worth being with.

The kid is sorted so I'm not going to make it as if I or you seize to exist. After all I think he or she will appreciate my libido because without it she wouldn't be there.
2017/08/07, 10:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Salatiso you saying I should leave was never a suggestion
2017/08/07, 10:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You told me clearly I was in your house and you were done
2017/08/07, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And all I've heard from you this entire discussion from your part is your wants and needs
2017/08/07, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And how right you are and wrong I am
2017/08/07, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not going to be bullied into a decision about a relationship with you
2017/08/07, 10:57 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Momentum allows for as hoc deposits into Health Saver Account, I will start to make some deposits so you don't deplete your MSA.

All I need from you is a reference number I should use, you can access it from your online profile.
2017/08/07, 10:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You're coming across as very selfish
2017/08/07, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: If I were to ever consider making a go at our relationship I would have to know what would change
2017/08/07, 10:58 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Cause I'm ok to never have the relationship I had with you the last year and a half we were together
2017/08/07, 10:59 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Selfish or not you're the one that knows what's good for you.

I'm not forcing you to do anything you don't want to and as always I've told you before you always put yourself first.

Put yourself first and give me an answer.
2017/08/07, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And you talking about yourself and your need is not encouraging
2017/08/07, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/08/07, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's not how relationships work Salatiso
2017/08/07, 10:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You just never want to hear this
2017/08/07, 11:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: One of the fundamental reasons we did not make it was that SUPER flawed reasoning on your part
2017/08/07, 11:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I am not going to change, everything I have done was for the greater good.

This I why I'm not panicking because I have planned for this eventuality.

Before you question my means show me you've done things otherwise and achieved the same results as I did or even better.

Then I will admit my means are wrong Nd you're right.
2017/08/07, 11:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Please do tell me what healthy sustainable relationship you have where both parties are happy?
2017/08/07, 11:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I can name quite a few
2017/08/07, 11:03 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please do
2017/08/07, 11:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Myself and Phakam
2017/08/07, 11:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Mom and me
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Sis B and me
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My sister
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Zukiswa
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Zekmari
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Gloria
2017/08/07, 11:04 AM - Mpho Mkosana: All these people I can call at anytime and know they would drop everything for me
2017/08/07, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And vise versa
2017/08/07, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And my uncle
2017/08/07, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I'm not saying they are perfect
2017/08/07, 11:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But it's working relationships
2017/08/07, 11:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Let's see, 

My whole family revere me.

Even when I told Siyabonga we were broken up he still was willing to help you.

My brother in law was fired from my company by me, yet we still have an excellent relationship.

Katlego, Collen, Mawetu, Siphe, Sifiso etc.

Heck, I'm the youngest in my street amongst my neighbours yet they respect me like I was their age.
2017/08/07, 11:07 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And those are my ride or dies, there are others who would also go a mile
2017/08/07, 11:07 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Exactly
2017/08/07, 11:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just because something isn't the way you know it to be doesn't mean it isn't.

My relationships work.
2017/08/07, 11:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Your family reveres you but hardly has a relationship with you
2017/08/07, 11:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Big Difference
2017/08/07, 11:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And I have heard this from their mouths
2017/08/07, 11:08 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said just because something isn't what you know it to be doesn't mean it isn't.
2017/08/07, 11:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hence I said where both parties are happy
2017/08/07, 11:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Arthur had to overcome his ish with you as you were about to become his brother
2017/08/07, 11:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That was just wisdom on his part
2017/08/07, 11:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said we have a different idea on relationships
2017/08/07, 11:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And as I have told you Marnier times
2017/08/07, 11:11 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Or an acknowledgement that I was right and he was wrong.

If his wisdom told me I was only good due to my sister then we wouldn't be talking business again, yet we are.
2017/08/07, 11:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not will to be treated badly at the alter of being in a relationship
2017/08/07, 11:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not going to be with someone who can't say sorry
2017/08/07, 11:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Admit they are wronf
2017/08/07, 11:12 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I understand.

And fully agree with you.
2017/08/07, 11:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Who I don't feel safe enough with to know I might get thrown out of his house when I'm heavily pregnant because I pointed out a flaw
2017/08/07, 11:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: When you can harp on my flaws non stop and I must just take it
2017/08/07, 11:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And even when I try which I at least do it's not good enough
2017/08/07, 11:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So just say it and you won't hear anything on the subject from me again
2017/08/07, 11:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Say you will never come back and I will close my doors.
2017/08/07, 11:15 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will repeat, I will not be bullied to say what you want me to say so you can turn around and say I made decisions.
2017/08/07, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I've told you what it would take for me to consider a us
2017/08/07, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's all I'm going to say
2017/08/07, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I never wanted to end our relationship
2017/08/07, 11:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I always wanted to work on it
2017/08/07, 11:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: U were the one who was constantly ready to Chuck it away
2017/08/07, 11:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Without even trying to make it woek
2017/08/07, 11:17 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So don't try to shift it on me
2017/08/07, 11:18 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So I'm saying I will not do what you said it will take and you're saying the same.

So that chapter is done. So let's please not belabour the point.

It's not good for your health.
2017/08/07, 11:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please don't forget,

I'll make the first contribution month end.
2017/08/07, 11:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/07, 3:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/08/07, 3:42 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thanks
2017/08/07, 3:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Please inform me if you are not going to make it
2017/08/07, 4:07 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: As it stands there's no evidence to suggest I won't make it.
2017/08/07, 4:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Is this the correct address;

Netcare Park Lane Hospital,
Junction Ave & Park Lane, Parktown, Johannesburg, 2193
2017/08/07, 4:23 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's opp that adress
2017/08/07, 4:24 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Right opp the hospital entrance
2017/08/07, 4:27 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/08/08, 5:23 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho

My father was not perfect. But for all the mistakes he made the one thing that makes up for all of them is the fact that he chose my mother to have me with.

I hope our child can one day say the same about me. Because I tried to do the same. I tried to look for someone that even if I died after s/he was conceived s/he would be in good hands.

I have no doubt you'll be a great mother. I am grateful that despite it going against everything you believe in you chose me to have your child with.

Going forward this is the context I want you to evaluate every statement I utter. There will be tough times when I become impossible as I know you'll have your moments. But I know what polarises us will make him/ her perfect because s/he'll have the best of both worlds.

So thank you in advance and more importantly apologies in advance. I have no intention of changing who I am and that means there will be things that I do/ say that despite my good intentions they will come out bad; apologies in advance.
2017/08/08, 7:02 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/08, 12:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What blood type are you?
2017/08/08, 12:40 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't know,

I will check. Ubuzela ntoni?
2017/08/08, 12:49 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Something to do with babies antibodies when he's born
2017/08/08, 3:13 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: B+
2017/08/08, 3:14 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks
2017/08/08, 3:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can you please confirm with Momentum if there's no waiting period in your medical aid since you just transferred there?
2017/08/08, 3:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Don't think so
2017/08/08, 3:19 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please confirm
2017/08/08, 3:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I already went for my blood tests and they paid out
2017/08/08, 3:20 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm just gonna have to change plans later this year so I can go to parklane
2017/08/08, 3:21 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I spoke to consultant re all that
2017/08/08, 3:35 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: As long as it's confirmed and you're covered.

I hate surprises.
2017/08/08, 11:07 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/08/08, 11:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Good Night
2017/08/08, 11:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Night
2017/08/10, 7:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho,

Unjani?
2017/08/10, 7:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Listen,

I apologize for the manner in which I went about dealing with things with you. Just because I meant well doesn't justify the sledgehammer approach I've used with you.

I am sorry.
2017/08/10, 7:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Thanks you, apology accepted
2017/08/10, 12:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So where to from here?
2017/08/10, 12:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't really know
2017/08/10, 12:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I get you want to be with your child but I also hear very clearly that you are who you are and good or bad you don't want to change
2017/08/10, 12:51 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Which kind of leaves us btwn a hard place and a rock really
2017/08/10, 12:53 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: My motivation to speed up the resolution of our issues is being driven by the child yes.

But I knew we were going to fix things anyway, hence I said you will come back.
2017/08/10, 12:54 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You are the only one who believes my motivation to be with you is the child.
2017/08/10, 12:54 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Anyway I have a plan if you're willing to hear it.
2017/08/10, 12:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Even if it weren't
2017/08/10, 12:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: We still have issue
2017/08/10, 12:55 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Please do share
2017/08/10, 12:55 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho go back to my earlier messages, you will see that I've always said you will come back.
2017/08/10, 12:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The issues we have are;
- You don't think you have as much of a role in that house because it's not your house but mine,
- There's things I'm inflexible about which you think I'm doing so unjustifiably.
2017/08/10, 12:58 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: So;
- If you remember from day one that house was supposed to be bought jointly between me and you, so we change it to between me and you.
2017/08/10, 1:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I will introduce you to someone whom I think you'll like whom I'm willing to have as a mediator.

She is in a sort of way like you and she's married to someone like me.

She comes from a well to do family, she's fun but serious at the same time. She's a judge and has spent a lot of time in family court. 

I'm willing to have her (subject to your meeting and approval) as a mediator/ advisor. I will commit to do what she advises should you agree, but you must also undertake to do the same.
2017/08/10, 1:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/10, 1:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'd be willing to do that
2017/08/10, 1:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Cool,

I'll set it up.
2017/08/12, 10:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: On my way
2017/08/12, 6:46 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: How's your friend
2017/08/13, 4:38 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How are you feeling today?
2017/08/13, 5:43 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Much better, did some chores, picked sis Yoliswa from the airport and now about to wash the car.
2017/08/13, 5:43 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: How's your day?

2017/08/13, 9:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Because you do
2017/08/13, 9:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So you've been drinking tea?
2017/08/13, 9:08 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: And veggie smoothie cos I'm not a fan of cooked veg...
2017/08/13, 9:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Been having a lot of veggie smoothies too
2017/08/13, 9:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: With spinach and beetroot
2017/08/13, 9:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And ginger, my fav
2017/08/13, 9:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Most definitely
2017/08/13, 9:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I feel like beetroot is best had in a smoothie....
2017/08/13, 9:11 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You got a juicer?
2017/08/13, 9:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just have to pray when I go to the gents no one is starring at my pee

2017/08/13, 9:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Good Night

2017/08/14, 3:45 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will pass on
2017/08/14, 3:45 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi, was with Sis Yoliswa this afternoon
2017/08/14, 3:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: She said she'd contact you
2017/08/14, 3:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That was quick.

I said to her you have a similar personality,

Do you think you have a similar personality?
2017/08/14, 3:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: when I called her she mentioned that the rest of the week was not gonna be looking great but she is available today and tomorrow so I went to receive
2017/08/14, 3:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't think I know her enough to be able to say we have similar personalities
2017/08/14, 3:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But I really like her a lot
2017/08/14, 4:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok cool
2017/08/15, 2:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Today is the first day that I have felt the effects of this pregnancy. I want to sleep so bad I would sell a human for a bed right now.
2017/08/15, 3:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yho,

I can imagine it must be tough getting through the day.

Let's hope the feeling won't be frequent.
2017/08/15, 8:08 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Wanted to check unjani but I figure u lele.
2017/08/15, 9:23 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ndiyakukhumbula
2017/08/15, 9:25 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 🙂
2017/08/16, 12:51 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/16, 1:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Was he seriously trying to run awau
2017/08/16, 1:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 🤦🏾‍♀
2017/08/16, 3:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I thought so too at first

Someone who's more of an optimist said maybe it was instinct and he was not thinking straight.

I choose to believe this version.
2017/08/17, 8:47 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo

Unjani?
2017/08/17, 8:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi
2017/08/17, 8:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Good and you?
2017/08/17, 8:48 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Nam ndiphilile
2017/08/17, 9:45 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hows yourself week so far?
2017/08/17, 9:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's been ok
2017/08/17, 9:47 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Yourself?
2017/08/17, 10:00 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's good, especially since I didn't go to work yesterday.
2017/08/17, 10:15 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7045445/great-tinder-interactions
2017/08/17, 10:55 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Lucky you
2017/08/17, 10:56 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's blocked
2017/08/17, 10:59 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Not really, ndijike endleleni.

I was stuck in that horrible N3 traffic, by the time I got to Buccleuch I had been driving for almost 1:30 minutes.

I turned back.
2017/08/17, 11:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's Horrible!
2017/08/17, 11:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: At least you're driving an automatic
2017/08/17, 11:21 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I was driving the Honda
2017/08/17, 11:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: ...At least you didn't waste petrol....
2017/08/17, 11:21 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Lol
2017/08/17, 11:22 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Speaking of cars,

What's your car's latest trade in vs your bank liability?

Or have you reconsidered getting rid of it?
2017/08/17, 11:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Have not checked
2017/08/17, 11:22 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Since last time I told you
2017/08/17, 11:23 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't know what I'm gonna about the car
2017/08/17, 11:26 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: If situation allows are you still keen on disposing it?
2017/08/17, 11:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Yeah
2017/08/17, 11:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: What would you consider to drive as an adequate replacement?
2017/08/17, 11:32 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Have nothing in mind currently.
2017/08/17, 11:33 AM - Mpho Mkosana: But NB would be economical and boot space for pram
2017/08/17, 11:41 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 11:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm still willing to help you if you need it.

I've a couple of ideas on a car that is;
- Safe,
- Practical,
- Reliable.

If you get a 2015 and later model of this it'll also come with a 200 000 km warranty.

It's economical; engines is 1.2 and 1.5.
2017/08/17, 11:50 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Boot space a class above the cars own.
2017/08/17, 11:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: What is this?
2017/08/17, 11:57 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 12:01 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/17, 12:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Price?
2017/08/17, 12:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Have you gotten that far?
2017/08/17, 12:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 12:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Is this a normal jazz?
2017/08/17, 12:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yep
2017/08/17, 12:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Best part, pre 2015 (from 2013) low mileage versions can be had for around R125k. 

Post 2015 from 140k.
2017/08/17, 12:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/17, 12:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You said a couple of ideas
2017/08/17, 12:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What else?
2017/08/17, 12:55 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 12:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Suzuki is not an option?
2017/08/17, 12:57 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 12:58 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Suzuki as a car should be reliable but I've never owned one so I can't vouch for it
2017/08/17, 12:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: ...Is this that Mazda you were trying to sell me on before???
2017/08/17, 12:58 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: This is a Mazda 3
2017/08/17, 12:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: How much is kadjar?
2017/08/17, 12:58 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That is a 6
2017/08/17, 12:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Low mileage from 260k
2017/08/17, 1:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Did Sis Yoliswa call you about possibility of meeting tomorrow?
2017/08/17, 1:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: No
2017/08/17, 1:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Just saw the Lexus ct 200 hybrid....need to play the lotto again
2017/08/17, 1:32 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: CT?

Are you sure?

That's an old car that Toyota hasn't updated in years
2017/08/17, 1:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: She told me she met with you.

So the next session will be a one on one with me.

Then we can have a joint session. 

You must remember I never briefed or told her much about anything because I didn't want to jeopardize her impartiality before she met with you.
2017/08/17, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/08/17, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's only been in rsa since last year
2017/08/17, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/08/17, 1:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/08/17, 1:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Trust me I know cars, especially Japanese cars.

This car is old, they just changed the grill and some aesthetics.

Underneath however it's probably a 2012 Auris.

If you buy it knowing it's old that's fine.
2017/08/17, 1:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But please note I'm not saying you can't meet together.
2017/08/17, 1:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No - was just going on what she said
2017/08/17, 1:52 PM - Mpho Mkosana: U meet, I'm cool
2017/08/17, 1:53 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Bummed, it's too much an old car, never mind
2017/08/17, 1:54 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Was excited re hybrid factor
2017/08/17, 1:58 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Just as long as you don't have unrealistic expectations for Hybrids, the Infiniti you drove was a performance hybrid.

Most hybrids are designed for economy and as such will drive and respond much more leisurely, nothing close to the Infiniti Q50 Hybrid.
2017/08/17, 1:58 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Oooo
2017/08/17, 2:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Current 'affordable' Hybrids in SA;
*Toyota*
- Yaris
- Auris

*Lexus*
- CT
- ES

*Honda*
- CRZ
- Jazz
- Insight
2017/08/17, 2:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: All of them geared towards fuel economy.
2017/08/17, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Jazz has hybrid?!?!?
2017/08/17, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Sorted then
2017/08/17, 2:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But will drive like a donkey right?
2017/08/17, 2:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes and no;
http://www.carmag.co.za/road_test/honda-jazz-hybrid-auto/
2017/08/17, 2:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes because they sold it in SA for the previous generation Jazz but you'll struggle to get hold of it in the used market
2017/08/17, 2:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Don't compare Honda's to my Honda.

My car was based on American specs (09 Acura TSX) hence it's so soft and wallowy.

Honda however realised this was not working for Euro and African spec so when they did a midlife update of my car it had better suspension, better throttle response and handled better.

So don't think all Honda's are lazy.
2017/08/17, 2:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But if you're looking for a car that punches above its weight for driveability look to Mazda; from the 2 upwards.
2017/08/17, 2:27 PM - Mpho Mkosana: ...becoming too complex now
2017/08/17, 2:29 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Let's just stick to original plan
2017/08/17, 2:36 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: You need to test drive the cars though and when you go ask them to give you a valuation of your car as a trade in.
2017/08/17, 2:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Yeah
2017/08/17, 2:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Can't do that anytime soon though
2017/08/17, 2:55 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Whenever it's convenient for you.

Thing about cars though, when they reach the trade in sweet spot you must act because after that generally your car depreciates quicker from a trade in perspective.
2017/08/17, 2:56 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 🤦🏾‍♀
2017/08/17, 3:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I know.

My Infiniti is t that spot now because when I called a dealer they said they'd settle my car, but we don't know how long that will last.

Fortunately for me I'm keeping my car.
2017/08/17, 3:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will email bmw
2017/08/17, 3:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Then just test top 2 cars jazz n clios cousin
2017/08/17, 3:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Clio's cousin?

What's that?
2017/08/17, 3:21 PM - Mpho Mkosana: The other car you recommended
2017/08/17, 3:21 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Karja
2017/08/17, 3:21 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Or something weird like that
2017/08/17, 3:23 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Kadjar,

The car it's based on is highly praised. Last year in the UK the Qashqai was the best selling car.

Renault improved on Nissan but improved it.
2017/08/17, 4:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hows work
2017/08/18, 2:00 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hey
2017/08/18, 2:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What time are you back at your house today?
2017/08/18, 2:03 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And what's for dinner
2017/08/18, 2:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

I'm flexible, mostly likely 5 pm latest but if you get there early I can arrange no Msitheli to leave the small gate opened and the back door is open.
2017/08/18, 2:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: What would you like for dinner?
2017/08/18, 2:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I don't know
2017/08/18, 2:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But it's always on my mind
2017/08/18, 2:05 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's fine
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will try to be there 5/after 5
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: ?

Dinner?
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Food
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Oh
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I squirrel it everywhere
2017/08/18, 2:06 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I need to know it's there
2017/08/18, 2:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 'squirrel'?
2017/08/18, 2:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: There's food in the house
2017/08/18, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I have food wherever I am
2017/08/18, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm the car
2017/08/18, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: In the office
2017/08/18, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: In my pockets
2017/08/18, 2:13 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Everywhere
2017/08/18, 2:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Sounds.....
2017/08/18, 2:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Demanding....
2017/08/18, 2:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/08/18, 2:50 PM - Mpho Mkosana: It's my reality
2017/08/18, 2:50 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Fortunately it'll pass....
2017/08/18, 4:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: In the house there's;
*Quick menu*
- Pie,
- Stuffed Chicken nuggets
- Chips (including sweet potato)
- Pizza

Then there's 
- Chicken
- Pork
- Eisbein
- Beef
- Spinach
- Broccoli
2017/08/18, 5:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: What flavour pie?
2017/08/18, 5:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Is it nice with no after taste?
2017/08/18, 5:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Chicken or eisben also sounds nice
2017/08/18, 5:18 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Whatever veg u want
2017/08/18, 5:21 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's Cornish as well and steak and pie 

No after taste
2017/08/18, 5:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: ....Can you make pie and some meat?
2017/08/18, 5:28 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Steak pie
2017/08/18, 5:32 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Left overs will be great for breakfast tomorrow
2017/08/18, 7:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can this be true?
Today if you add your age + your year of birth, it gives you 2017... It happens only today, and it is once in 1000 years... Just try it.
2017/08/19, 8:30 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Do you have ice cream?
2017/08/21, 12:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/08/21, 12:42 PM - Mpho Mkosana: So am at the sweet spot re my car
2017/08/21, 12:44 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm thinking of a juke as well, it's well priced and elevated which is the 1 - ve of the jazz
2017/08/21, 12:45 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Guess you're gonna have to start the test driving
2017/08/21, 12:45 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I drove the Honda jazz Saturday
2017/08/21, 12:45 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And?
2017/08/21, 12:46 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Maybe even Rav 4
2017/08/21, 12:47 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hardship with low car is having to bend to get him out of the car
2017/08/21, 12:48 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: SUV's are not safe,

Contrary to popular belief.
2017/08/21, 12:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But theses aren't full on Suvs
2017/08/21, 12:48 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You still have not given Honda feedback
2017/08/21, 1:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: The higher you go above the centre of gravity the more unstable a car is.
2017/08/21, 1:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's not for me to give feedback, you need to experience a car yourself.
2017/08/21, 1:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I get tgatr
2017/08/21, 1:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm asking your opinion
2017/08/21, 1:02 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not saying buy it for me
2017/08/21, 1:03 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: But my proposal is simple;
- If you buy a Jazz at a reasonable price I will help you and if you don't like the car in 3 years I will buy it from you.
- any other car that deal is off.
2017/08/21, 1:04 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I like the Jazz, it's a small car that has practicallity comparable almost to the accord and it drives well.
2017/08/21, 1:04 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok so your offer to help is conditional
2017/08/21, 1:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Off course it is.

The only reason I'm willing to help you with the car is because I think your current car is stressing you, both from an affordability perspective and reliability.

So the next car you buy logically should have neither of those, you should pay less and it must last longer.

If those 2 things are not an issue then it means you don't need help.
2017/08/21, 1:20 PM - Mpho Mkosana: 2nd hand juke is less than my current car
2017/08/21, 1:20 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But it's fine
2017/08/21, 1:20 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'll sort myself out
2017/08/21, 1:56 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ok
2017/08/21, 2:00 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: When I had a chat no Sis Yoliswa last week I Indicated that between wena naye you can coordinate when we meet.

So she might contact you.
2017/08/22, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: A lil birdie just told me infinity is leaving Rsa....
2017/08/22, 11:05 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: That would be awesome, then current cars would still be current 10 years from now.
2017/08/23, 9:05 AM - Mpho Mkosana: <Media omitted>
2017/08/23, 10:25 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: 😂
2017/08/26, 6:20 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Saw a missed call from you
2017/08/26, 7:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi

Bekungekho nto, bendijonga uba usahleli.
2017/08/27, 10:51 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ryobi Electric Wood Working Centre: https://www.onedayonly.co.za/electric-wood-working-centre-3.html
2017/08/27, 1:13 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 👍🏿
2017/08/27, 4:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/08/27, 4:08 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Who sent that to u?
2017/08/27, 4:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not at liberty to disclose
2017/08/31, 9:24 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Hi Salatiso
2017/08/31, 9:26 PM - Mpho Mkosana: My family asked me to convey that they would be coming through Sat 23rd Sept
2017/08/31, 10:17 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hi
2017/08/31, 10:18 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm not sure how this works,

I'll confirm and get back to you.
2017/08/31, 10:59 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Why am I being told though when they are coming?

Aren't you supposed to consult with me for a suitable date?
2017/09/01, 3:16 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As far as I know they inform when they will be comig
2017/09/01, 5:44 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: You can't say that as though this is cast in stone.

Besides there's extenuating circumstances here, where will they be going; e Dutywa?

So this is why it's important to clear things in advance after you've discussed with me.

Tell your family that date is tentative.

I don't take too well to being dictated to. Manage your family as I do mine, inbetween you consult not dictate.
2017/09/01, 7:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You also have to remember that they are coming from PE Salatiso,hence that long weekend was chosen.
2017/09/01, 7:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You acting like a beat out of hibernation is not going to help the situation. And please watch your tone with me. I am not your child
2017/09/01, 7:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: My family are observing our traditional norms by giving you a date.
2017/09/01, 7:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: 4 weeks in advance
2017/09/01, 7:13 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You being aggressive is unnecessary
2017/09/01, 7:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Do it your way,

They can come I'll be at my house.

Be warned however, doing things without consultation will not end well for you.
2017/09/01, 7:53 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: If you were being reasonable you would have proposed a date, not come with an altimatum or instruction.
2017/09/01, 7:59 AM - Mpho Mkosana: There was no ultimatum Salatiso
2017/09/01, 8:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said we are following tradition
2017/09/01, 8:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Traditionally you give the family a date
2017/09/01, 8:00 AM - Mpho Mkosana: We did that
2017/09/01, 8:02 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You could have come back and said that date doesn't work instead of chucking your toys and saying we are giving ultimatums
2017/09/01, 8:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Instead you start threatening me?
2017/09/01, 8:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Seriously?
2017/09/01, 8:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't make threats, I state facts.

To you is it consultative to come to me with a date that suits only you and your family?

Did you consider that there's both yours and my family involved?
2017/09/01, 8:07 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You are clearly once again trying to pick a fight. If you are in that mood, please make a concerted effort not to address me until you have gotten .yourself in check. I'm not your punching bag. And I refuse to have a stressed pregnancy because of you
2017/09/01, 8:08 AM - Mpho Mkosana: This is a threat
2017/09/01, 8:09 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No 2 ways about it
2017/09/01, 8:10 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Go speak to your family - ask them how things are done. At no point in our convo did I say that's the only day take it or leave it. Instead you jumped to conclusions of ultimatums
2017/09/01, 8:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: As I said, 

They can come, I'll be at my house as always.

I'm not going to get my family involved in something that is not done right.

A child is a product of 2 people, with 2 different backgrounds and cultures. This is why there must be constructive consultation and engagement before execution.
2017/09/01, 8:14 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/09/01, 8:14 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I will tell my family
2017/09/01, 8:15 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Secondly while the principle behind traditional application is not consistent.

Again this is why it's so important that there must be consultation. What you do in your family is not what I do in my family hence you consult.
2017/09/01, 8:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: "Secondly while the principle behind tradition is the same application is not consistent."

Again this is why it's so important that there must be consultation. What you do in your family is not what I do in my family hence you consult.
2017/09/01, 8:19 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please do and even better if your quote me.

Do not be adversarial, it doesn't serve you any good.

Talk, from day one I've been willing to listen.
2017/09/01, 8:32 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: At any point you feel I'm unreasonable you can at any time bring u sis Yoliswa to the picture.

It's not a mistake that I got her in the picture at this point. At a professional level she's got extensive experience in family law, at a personal level she will empathise with you and at a logical level she is extremely reasonable and pragmatic.
2017/09/01, 8:53 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Can you please start reading or consulting on parenting plans?

We will need one in place to avoid ambiguity and to strictly specify enforcement of rights and obligations.

This will be formalised and lodged with the family advocate. 

As I said it is not in my interests to be adversarial or to have conflict so this will ensure that expectations are based on tangible facts.
2017/09/01, 8:54 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not sure what you are talking about when you say parenting plans?
2017/09/01, 8:57 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So I consulted someone now about my What's app and apparently my tone was aggressive in the Whatsapp - which I apologise for. I will start again. Please speak to your family and see if the 23rd Sept will work for them. Do you want them to come to Joburg or Dutywa?
2017/09/01, 9:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Ok
2017/09/01, 9:01 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Thank you, apology accepted.

I will speak to them.

As far as I know the need for your family to come to my family is nullified if I accept partenity. In this case it is my family that goes to yours to pay the damages.
2017/09/01, 9:01 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Read up on family planning
2017/09/01, 9:02 AM - Mpho Mkosana: That's fine you can set it up
2017/09/01, 9:02 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hence I asked you to either read up on them or consult someone who does.
2017/09/01, 9:02 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I don't understand.

Are you saying I must read up on family planning?
2017/09/01, 9:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: No
2017/09/01, 9:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Did you not just say you want one in place?
2017/09/01, 9:03 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So you can do it is what I'm saying
2017/09/01, 9:07 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Again Mpho please stick to the spirit of consultation and fairness.

A parental plan is not unilaterally imposed but rather agreed through engagement by the parents.

I'm well versed on the legislative requirements but in the interests of fairness I want you to take some time to understand what it is. In cases that after reading/ consultation you are still unclear I have availed a resources that is at your disposal to clarify issues.
2017/09/01, 9:11 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said I have read up on it
2017/09/01, 9:12 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm not sure what else you are looking for
2017/09/01, 9:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Sorry missed the confirmation that you read up on it.

Cool
2017/09/01, 9:18 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Just spoke with my uncle, he says if you had wanted to come to them and acknowledge situation a date should have been given to them
2017/09/01, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Cause if they don't bring isisu your family can turn and say why didn't we do it as per culture
2017/09/01, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's not about what you say to me
2017/09/01, 9:19 AM - Mpho Mkosana: It's what you say to the family
2017/09/01, 9:26 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Again ayiyondlela yokuthetha le. 

The reason I was explicit in acknowledging partenity in my first correspondence to you after you told me was to show that andiphiki.

Based on that I expected you to consult with you family and if they have expectations in terms of timelines we could arrange to meet each other halfway.

Ekhaya umtu akayi in the first couple of weeks to pay damages. I was explicit to you that I will send my family to yours.

Please be careful about invoking tradition as though it's inflexible. When there's something that is unclear you bring it to the foe and we discuss.

Culture and tradition exists to serve the people not the other way around. Because of differing interpretation isintu allows for negotiation as long as the principle is adhered to.

In future don't make assumptions about what my family will or will not do or imply, xa ungaqinisekanga buza.
2017/09/01, 9:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm making no assumptions
2017/09/01, 9:27 AM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm telling you what I've been told
2017/09/01, 9:28 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You never at any point told me to convey a message to my family about you coming Salatiso
2017/09/01, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So I'm not sure what you expected me to say to them
2017/09/01, 9:29 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And u never at any point said that the first couple of weeks your family does nothing
2017/09/01, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: So I know no such thing
2017/09/01, 9:30 AM - Mpho Mkosana: This is totally draining me
2017/09/01, 9:31 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Please get back to me with your plan of action and I will convey to my family
2017/09/01, 9:31 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Please read point #2 of this correspondence.
2017/09/01, 9:32 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hence you ask when unclear.
2017/09/01, 9:33 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Yet you skip the whole part where u said upon confirmation of paternity once child is born
2017/09/01, 9:34 AM - Mpho Mkosana: How do I ask about something I know nothing about?
2017/09/01, 9:34 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Where u expecting me to come to you and ask when you're seeing my family?
2017/09/01, 9:35 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Yes I expected you to do so.

Or I expected you to come to me and tell me what expectations your family has.

Then I align with my and we come to an amicable solution.
2017/09/01, 9:36 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Then I think you were being unrealistic
2017/09/01, 9:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: If your intention was to go you should have made that clear
2017/09/01, 9:37 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You didn't
2017/09/01, 9:42 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: But why is it so difficult to you to ask when there's ambiguity?

To date I haven't made any demands, imposed any expectations or dictated any terms to you.

I have asked, I have consulted and I have communicated.

Consultation is actually aimed at making sure that your family doesn't come here unnecessary or come here when I won't be when there's a need.

This is not difficult, just ask when you're not clear or want to know.
2017/09/01, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You're diverting
2017/09/01, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You did not say you have intentions to go see my family
2017/09/01, 9:43 AM - Mpho Mkosana: At any point
2017/09/01, 9:44 AM - Mpho Mkosana: You Said you would pay
2017/09/01, 9:44 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Once baby was born
2017/09/01, 9:44 AM - Mpho Mkosana: And you get paternity test
2017/09/01, 9:45 AM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said please consult with your family and get back to me either way
2017/09/01, 9:45 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Will be waiting for your paternity plan
2017/09/01, 9:53 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

Just ask and I'll answer.

Right now you've just worked yourself up for a conflict that started because you were wrong.

The root cause of this whole conversation is what has been confirmed to be your error. I'm trying to put a control so that this doesn't happen again.

By now you should know I do what I deem to be right; neither my family nor your family nor tradition nor you will dictate to be what is right about my child.

I will however consult with you as the mother taking into confidence my family, your family and tradition.
2017/09/01, 10:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So ekhaya abantu baya when there's signs zokubonakala kwesisu, so can send my people to you between September & December.

Alternatively I'm flexible to have your family come, please note however that I wouldn't advise this if it incurs unnecessary expenses. If your family was coming to Joburg in the week of the 20th then by all means they can come but if they were coming solely for this then that's an unnecessary expense I would advise against.

Should your family feel that the period between September and December is too far I'm flexible, I can make an alternative plan but you'll have to give me at least to optional dates.

So you can consult and confirm with me what works.
2017/09/01, 10:14 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Meant 2 dates as options.
2017/09/01, 6:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I have as a Telkom benefit to a wellness program which extends to my family/ partner. If ever you feel you need to talk to someone (emotional / financial/ legal advice etc) the service is available.

I think however it's confined to people I stay with so should you need to use it say you stay with me or did until we faught and you moved out.

Their contact number is 0800611101, my employee number is 04508727 and I work for Gyro.
2017/09/01, 6:47 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
2017/09/05, 9:46 AM - Mpho Mkosana: Just got a call from Colombine Vet, they say Skhokho is overdue for Injections and Khali is due. They have 20% off Wed and Sat
2017/09/05, 9:56 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Molo Mpho, noted thanks.
2017/09/05, 5:02 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I'm getting very annoying with these probes I'm getting regarding lento yabantu bakokwenu.

I sent you a choice which you never responded to.

Resolve it, otherwise I will stop being reasonable and forbid anyone from setting foot in my house.
2017/09/05, 5:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Probes?
2017/09/05, 5:09 PM - Mpho Mkosana: My family is contacting you?
2017/09/05, 5:15 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Or are you referring to the fact that your family has been contacting me
2017/09/05, 5:16 PM - Mpho Mkosana: And instead of you dealing with your family you feel the need to crack me out???
2017/09/05, 5:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: If your intention is to stress me out to the point where I miscarry you are doing a great job
2017/09/05, 5:17 PM - Mpho Mkosana: My family is coming on the 23rd if you do not welcome them that is your option
2017/09/05, 5:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: As I said before if you do not figure out how to talk to me / address me please stop contacting me
2017/09/05, 5:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm done with your verbal emotional abuse
2017/09/05, 5:19 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You might not care about this child I am carrying I do and this is where I draw line
2017/09/05, 5:31 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Mpho,

Friday after the misunderstanding I gave you an offer with options one of which was consistent to what you wanted, you never responded.

Same day I get a call from u Sis Yoliswa chastising me, only after I explained did she understand.

Today I'm getting a barrage of messages from my family, again I explain.

Now how am I not to believe that you're the one who's inciting all this if the last message I sent you with the options was never responded to?
2017/09/05, 5:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Because you only see what you want to see Salatiso
2017/09/05, 5:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I had said if that date does not work for you give another day
2017/09/05, 5:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Dololo
2017/09/05, 5:33 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I must always be jumping to your bidding
2017/09/05, 5:34 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm done
2017/09/05, 5:34 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: How do I see what I want to see?

This is the message.

Did you respond?
2017/09/05, 5:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: You can believe whatever horrible things you want to believe about me
2017/09/05, 5:35 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I past caring
2017/09/05, 5:35 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: This is the first time since Friday that I hear you decided to go with the 23rd.
2017/09/05, 5:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: All I'm asking is you leave me alone cause all you seem to be to me is mean
2017/09/05, 5:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I'm done
2017/09/05, 5:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Please don't come to appt
2017/09/05, 5:36 PM - Mpho Mkosana: I will send you all the info I get
2017/09/05, 5:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Will not exclude you
2017/09/05, 5:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: But don't want you near me
2017/09/05, 5:37 PM - Mpho Mkosana: Leave me alone
2017/09/05, 5:39 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I note that and I will respect it.

Anything between me and you is officially over, I will respect that.

I will honour your wishes. Do me a favor though, please arrange to get your stuff out my house because now that you've confirmed there's no prospect of you coming back I also would like to move on and now have constant reminders of you in my house.

Please.
2017/09/05, 6:01 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: When you do come please give me a 2 day in advance so that I can arrange that either I or U Msitheli will be here.

Applicable to both weekdays and weekends.
