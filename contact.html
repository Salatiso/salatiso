            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I’m Salatiso Mdeni—a South African author, advocate, and dad who’s all about cutting through the noise. I write books that call out broken systems and lift up families, from <em>Goliath’s Reckoning</em>’s courtroom battles to <em>The Perfect Cage</em>’s dystopian twists. As the founder of <a href="https://flamea.org">flamea.org</a>, I’m fighting for a world where fathers are equals and kids’ needs come first, no matter what.</p>
            <p>I’m proud as hell of my degree in Environmental Health. It taught me to spot risks and protect what matters, a skill I’ve honed for over 20 years. But I’m just as proud of walking away from my LLB, three modules shy of the finish line. Why ditch it? Principle. The High Court, meant to be the “upper guardian” of kids, has been sleeping on the job, letting Children’s Courts favor moms and sideline dads. I laid it out in my article, <em>The High Court’s Failure as the Upper Guardian</em>—the system’s rigged, and I wasn’t about to join a club that rubber-stamps discrimination. Qualifying would’ve meant signing up with a court I think’s part of the problem, one that’s failed to uphold equality and kids’ best interests. Dropping out cost me the fancy title and perks, but I’d rather stand for what’s right than bow to a broken machine.</p>
            <p>Life’s taught me to manage risks, not just in work but in how I live—always planning ahead to keep my family strong, like I wrote in <em>Risk Management within the Personal Context</em>. Through <a href="https://flamea.org">flamea.org</a>, I’m pushing for fair courts and real change, using my books as a megaphone to spark conversations. When I’m not writing, I’m homeschooling my kids, nerding out on AI, or swapping stories in English, Nguni, and Sotho. I keep it real, a bit scrappy, and always ready to challenge the status quo with a grin.</p>
